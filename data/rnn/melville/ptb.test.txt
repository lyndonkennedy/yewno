tropical afternoon that we made good our escape from the bay the vessel we sought lay with her maintopsail <unk> about a league from the land and was the only object that broke the broad expanse of the ocean on approaching she turned out to be a small <unk> craft her hull and spars a <unk> black rigging all slack and bleached nearly white and everything <unk> an ill state of affairs aboard the four boats hanging from her sides proclaimed her a whaler leaning carelessly over the bulwarks were the sailors wild <unk> fellows in scotch caps and faded blue frocks some of them with cheeks of a <unk> <unk> to which sickness soon <unk> the rich <unk> of a seamans complexion in the tropics on the quarterdeck was one whom i took for the chief mate he wore a <unk> <unk> hat and his spyglass was levelled as we advanced when we came alongside a low cry ran fore and aft the deck and everybody gazed at us with inquiring eyes and well they might to say nothing of the savage boats crew panting with excitement all gesture and <unk> my own appearance was calculated to excite curiosity a robe of the native cloth was thrown over my shoulders my hair and beard were <unk> and i betrayed other <unk> of my recent adventure immediately on gaining the deck they beset me on all sides with questions the half of which i could not answer so incessantly were they put as an instance of the curious <unk> which often befall the sailor i must here mention that two countenances before me were familiar one was that of an old manofwarsman whose acquaintance i had made in rio de <unk> at which place touched the ship in which i sailed from home the other was a young man whom four years previous i had frequently met in a sailor <unk> in <unk> i remembered parting with him at princes <unk> <unk> in the midst of a swarm of <unk> <unk> <unk> beggars and the like and here we were <unk> had rolled by many a league of ocean had been traversed and we were thrown together under circumstances which almost made me doubt my own existence but a few moments passed ere i was sent for into the cabin by the captain he was quite a young man pale and slender more like a sickly <unk> clerk than a bluff seacaptain bidding me be seated he ordered the steward to hand me a glass of <unk> in the state i was this stimulus almost made me delirious so that of all i then went on to relate concerning my residence on the island i can scarcely remember a word after this i was asked whether i desired to ship of course i said yes that is if he would allow me to enter for one cruise engaging to discharge me if i so desired at the next port in this way men are frequently shipped on board whalemen in the south seas my <unk> was <unk> to and the ships articles handed me to sign the mate was now called below and charged to make a well man of me not let it be borne in mind that the captain felt any great <unk> for me he only desired to have the benefit of my services as soon as possible helping me on deck the mate stretched me out on the windlass and commenced examining my limb and then <unk> it after a fashion with something from the <unk> rolled it up in a piece of an old sail making so big a bundle that with my feet resting on the windlass i might have been taken for a sailor with the <unk> while this was going on <unk> removing my tappa cloak slipped on a blue frock in its place and another <unk> by the same desire to make a civilized mortal of me flourished about my head a great pair lie imminent <unk> of both ears and the certain destruction of hair and beard the day was now drawing to a close and as the land faded from my sight i was all alive to the change in my condition but how far short of our expectations is oftentimes the <unk> of the most ardent hopes safe aboard of a <unk> long my earnest <unk> home and friends once more in prospect i nevertheless felt weighed down by a melancholy that could not be shaken off it was the thought of never more seeing those who notwithstanding their desire to retain me a captive had upon the whole treated me so kindly i was leaving them for ever so unforeseen and sudden had been my escape so excited had i been through it all and so great the contrast between the luxurious repose of the valley and the wild noise and motion of a ship at sea that at times my recent adventures had all the strangeness of a dream and i could scarcely believe that the same sun now setting over a waste of waters had that very morning risen above the mountains and peered in upon me as i lay on my mat in typee going below into the forecastle just after dark i was <unk> into a wretched <unk> or <unk> built over another the <unk> <unk> of both were spread with several pieces of a blanket a battered tin can was then handed me containing about half a <unk> of <unk> called by courtesy though whether the juice of such <unk> as one finds floating therein deserves that title is a matter all <unk> must settle with their <unk> a <unk> of salt beef on a hard round biscuit by way of <unk> was also handed up and without more ado i made a meal the salt flavour of which after the <unk> fare of the valley was positively delicious while thus engaged an old sailor on a chest just under me was puffing out volumes of tobacco smoke my supper finished he brushed the stem of his sooty pipe against the <unk> of his frock and politely waved it toward me the attention was <unk> as for the <unk> of the thing no man who has lived in <unk> is at all fastidious and so after a few vigorous <unk> to induce repose i turned over and tried my best to forget myself but in vain my <unk> instead of extending fore and aft as it should have done was placed athwart ships that is at right angles to the keel and the vessel going before the wind rolled to such a degree <unk> time my heels went up and my head went down i thought i was on the point of turning a <unk> beside this there were still more annoying causes of <unk> and every once in a while a <unk> of water came down the open scuttle and flung the spray in my face at last after a sleepless night broken twice by the <unk> call of the watch a peep of daylight struggled into view from above and <unk> came below it was my old friend with the pipe here shipmate said i help me out of this place and let me go on deck halloa whos that <unk> was the rejoinder as he peered into the obscurity where i lay ay typee my king of the cannibals is it you i but i say my lad <unk> that spar of <unk> the mate says its in a devil of a way and last night set the steward to <unk> the <unk> hope he wont have the carving of ye long before daylight we arrived off the bay of nukuheva and making short <unk> until morning we then ran in and sent a boat ashore with the natives who had brought me to the ship upon its return we made sail again and stood off from the land there was a fine breeze and notwithstanding my bad nights rest the cool fresh air of a morning at sea was so bracing mat as soon as i breathed it my spirits rose at once seated upon the windlass the greater portion of the day and chatting freely with the men i learned the history of the voyage thus far and everything respecting the ship and its present condition these matters i will now throw together in the next chapter chapter ii some account of the ship first and foremost i must give some account of the <unk> herself or little <unk> as the sailors familiarly styled her she was a small <unk> of a beautiful model something more than two hundred tons <unk> and very old fitted for a <unk> out of a new england port during the war of <unk> she had been captured at sea by a british <unk> and after seeing all sorts of service was at last employed as a government packet in the <unk> seas being condemned however about two years previous she was purchased at auction by a house in <unk> who after some slight <unk> dispatched her on the present voyage notwithstanding the <unk> she was still in a miserable plight the lower masts were said to be <unk> the standing rigging was much worn and in some places even the bulwarks were quite rotten still she was tolerably tight and but little more than the ordinary <unk> of a morning served to keep her free but all this had nothing to do with her sailing at that brave little <unk> plump little <unk> was a witch blow high or blow low she was always ready for the breeze and when she dashed the waves from her prow and <unk> and <unk> the sea you never thought of her patched sails and <unk> hull how the fleet creature would fly before the wind rolling now and then to be sure but in very <unk> sailing to windward no gale could bow her over with spars erect she looked right up into the winds eye and so she went but after all little <unk> was not to be <unk> in lively enough and playful she was but on that very account the more to be <unk> who knew but that like some vivacious old mortal all at once sinking into a decline she might some dark night spring a leak and carry us all to the bottom however she played us no such ugly trick and therefore i wrong little <unk> in supposing it she had a free roving commission according to her papers she might go whither she <unk> <unk> or anything else sperm whaling however was what she relied upon though as yet only two fish had been brought alongside the day they sailed out of <unk> heads the ships company all told <unk> some <unk> souls now they mustered about twenty the rest had deserted even the three junior mates who had headed the whaleboats were gone and of the four <unk> only one was left a wild new <unk> or <unk> as his countrymen are more commonly called in the pacific but this was not all more than half the seamen remaining were more or less <unk> from a long sojourn in a <unk> port some of them wholly <unk> for duty one or two <unk> ill and the rest <unk> to stand their watch though they could do but little the captain was a young <unk> who a few years before had <unk> to <unk> and by some <unk> or other had procured the command of the vessel though in no wise competent he was essentially a landsman and though a man of education no more meant for the sea than a <unk> hence everybody made fun of him they called him the cabin boy paper jack and half a dozen other <unk> names in truth the men made no secret of the <unk> in which they held him and as for the slender gentleman himself he knew it all very well and bore himself with becoming <unk> holding as little intercourse with them as possible he left everything to the chief mate who as the story went had been given his captain in charge yet despite his apparent <unk> the silent captain had more to do with the men than they thought in short although one of your <unk> fellows he had a sort of still timid cunning which no one would have suspected and which for that very reason was all the more active so the bluff mate who always thought he did what he pleased was occasionally made a fool of and some obnoxious measures which he carried out in spite of all <unk> were little thought to <unk> with the <unk> little fellow in <unk> jacket and white canvas pumps but to all appearance at least the mate had everything his own way indeed in most things this was actually the case and it was quite plain that the captain stood in awe of him so far as courage seamanship and a natural <unk> for keeping riotous spirits in <unk> were concerned no man was better qualified for his vocation than john <unk> he was the very <unk> of the <unk> race of short <unk> men his hair curled in little rings of iron gray all over his round bullet head as for his countenance it was strongly marked deeply <unk> with the <unk> for the rest there was a fierce little <unk> out of one eye the nose had a <unk> twist to one side while his large mouth and great white teeth looked absolutely <unk> when he laughed in a word no one after getting a fair look at him would ever think of improving the shape of his nose wanting in symmetry as it was notwithstanding his <unk> looks however <unk> had a heart as big as a <unk> that you saw at a glance such was our mate but he had one failing he abhorred all weak <unk> and <unk> <unk> to strong drink at all times he was more or less under the influence of it taken in moderate quantities i believe in my soul it did a man like him good <unk> his eyes swept the <unk> out of his brain and <unk> his pulse but the worst of it was that sometimes he drank too much and a more obstreperous fellow than <unk> in his cups you seldom came across he was always for having a fight but the very men he flogged loved him as a brother for he had such an irresistibly goodnatured way of knocking them down that no one could find it in his heart to bear malice against him so much for stout little <unk> all english whalemen are bound <unk> to carry a physician who of course is <unk> a gentleman and lives in the cabin with nothing but his professional duties to attend to but incidentally he <unk> <unk> and plays cards with the captain there was such a worthy aboard of the <unk> but curious to tell he lived in the forecastle with the men and this was the way it happened in the early part of the voyage the doctor and the captain lived together as pleasantly as could be to say nothing of many a can they drank over the cabin transom both of them had read books and one of them had <unk> so their stories never <unk> but once on a time they got into a <unk> about <unk> and the doctor moreover getting into a rage drove home an argument with his fist and left the captain on the floor literally <unk> this was carrying it with a high hand so he was shut up in his stateroom for ten days and left to <unk> on bread and water and the <unk> of flying into a passion <unk> under his disgrace he <unk> a short time after his <unk> to leave the vessel clandestinely at one of the islands but was brought back ignominiously and again shut up being set at large for the second time he vowed he would not live any longer with the captain and went forward with his chests among the sailors where he was received with open arms as a good fellow and an injured man i must give some further account of him for he figures largely in the narrative his early history like that of many other heroes was enveloped in the profoundest obscurity though he threw out hints of a <unk> estate a <unk> uncle and an unfortunate affair which sent him <unk> all that was known however was this he had gone out to <unk> as <unk> of an <unk> ship on his arrival there he went back into the country and after a few months wanderings returned to <unk> penniless and entered as doctor aboard of the <unk> his personal appearance was remarkable he was over six feet <unk> tower of bones with a complexion absolutely <unk> fair hair and a light unscrupulous gray eye twinkling occasionally at the very devil of mischief among the crew he went by the name of the long doctor or more frequently still doctor long ghost and from whatever high estate doctor long ghost might have fallen he had certainly at some time or other spent money drunk <unk> and <unk> with gentlemen as for his learning he quoted <unk> and talked of <unk> of <unk> beside repeating poetry by the <unk> especially <unk> he was moreover a man who had seen the world in the easiest way imaginable he could refer to an <unk> he had in <unk> his <unk> before breakfast among the <unk> and the quality of the coffee to be drunk in <unk> and about these places and a hundred others he had more <unk> than i can tell of then such mellow old songs as he sang in a voice so round and <unk> the real juice of sound how such notes came forth from his lank body was a constant marvel upon the whole long ghost was as entertaining a companion as one could wish and to me in the <unk> an absolute <unk> chapter iii further account of the <unk> owing to the absence of anything like regular discipline the vessel was in a state of the greatest uproar the captain having for some time past been more or less confined to the cabin from sickness was seldom seen the mate however was as hearty as a young lion and ran about the decks making himself heard at all hours <unk> the new zealand <unk> held little intercourse with anybody but the mate who could talk to him freely in his own <unk> part of his time he spent out on the bowsprit fishing for <unk> with a bone hook and occasionally he waked all hands up of a dark night dancing some cannibal <unk> all by himself on the forecastle but upon the whole he was remarkably quiet though something in his eye showed he was far from being harmless doctor long ghost having sent in a written <unk> as the ships doctor gave himself out as a passenger for <unk> and took the world quite easy as for the crew those who were sick seemed <unk> <unk> for men in their condition and the rest not displeased with the general <unk> gave themselves little thought of the morrow the <unk> provisions were very poor when opened the barrels of pork looked as if preserved in iron rust and diffused an <unk> like a <unk> <unk> the beef was worse yet a <unk> <unk> substance so tough and <unk> that i almost believed the cooks story of a horses <unk> with the shoe on having been fished up out of the pickle of one of the casks nor was the biscuit much better nearly all of it was broken into hard little <unk> <unk> through and through as if the worms usually <unk> this article in long tropical voyages had in <unk> after <unk> come out at the <unk> without finding anything of what sailors call small stores we had but little tea however we had in abundance though i dare say the <unk> merchants never had the shipping of it beside this every other day we had what english seamen call shot <unk> round peas polishing themselves like pebbles by rolling about in <unk> water it was afterward told me that all our provisions had been purchased by the owners at an auction sale of condemned navy stores in <unk> but notwithstanding the <unk> of the first course of <unk> and the <unk> flavour of the beef and pork a sailor might have made a satisfactory meal aboard of the <unk> had there been any side <unk> <unk> or two a <unk> or a <unk> but there was nothing of the kind still there was something else which in the estimation of the men made up for all <unk> and that was the regular allowance of <unk> it may seem strange that in such a state of affairs the captain should be willing to keep the sea with his ship but the truth was that by lying in harbour he ran the risk of losing the remainder of his men by <unk> and as it was he still feared that in some outlandish bay or other he might one day find his anchor down and no crew to weigh it with judicious officers the most <unk> seamen can at sea be kept in some sort of <unk> but once get them within a cables length of the land and it is hard <unk> them it is for this reason that many south sea whalemen do not come to anchor for eighteen or twenty months on a stretch when fresh provisions are needed they run for the nearest <unk> to eight or ten miles off and send a boat ashore to trade the crews <unk> vessels like these are for the most part <unk> of all nations and <unk> picked up in the <unk> ports of the spanish main and among the savages of the islands like <unk> they are only to be governed by <unk> and chains their officers go among them with <unk> and <unk> but ready at a grasp not a few of our own crew were men of this stamp but riotous at times as they were the bluff <unk> <unk> of <unk> were just the thing to hold them in some sort of noisy <unk> upon an <unk> he flew in among them <unk> his <unk> and <unk> right and left and creating a sensation in every direction and as hinted before they bore this <unk> authority with great <unk> a sober discreet dignified officer could have done nothing with them such a set would have thrown him and his dignity overboard matters being thus there was nothing for the ship but to keep the sea nor was the captain without hope that the invalid portion of his crew as well as himself would soon recover and then there was no telling what luck in the fishery might yet be in store for us at any rate at the time of my coming aboard the report was that captain <unk> was resolved upon <unk> the past and filling the vessel with oil in the <unk> space possible with this intention we were now <unk> our course for <unk> a village on the island of st <unk> of the marquesas and so named by <unk> the purpose of <unk> eight seamen who some weeks before had stepped ashore there from the <unk> it was supposed that by this time they must have <unk> themselves sufficiently and would be glad to return to their duty so to <unk> with all our canvas spread and <unk> with the warm <unk> trades we <unk> along gliding up and down the long slow swells the <unk> and <unk> <unk> round us chapter iv a scene in the forecastle i had scarcely been aboard of the ship twentyfour hours when a circumstance occurred which although <unk> picturesque is so significant of the state of affairs that i cannot forbear relating it in the first place however it must be known that among the crew was a man so <unk> ugly that he went by the <unk> appellation of beauty he was the ships carpenter and for that reason was sometimes known by his nautical <unk> of chips there was no absolute <unk> about the man he was <unk> ugly but ill <unk> as he was in person beauty was none the less ugly in temper but no one could blame him his countenance had <unk> his heart now <unk> and beauty were always at swords points the truth was the latter was the only man in the ship whom the mate had never <unk> got the better of and hence the grudge he bore him as for beauty he <unk> himself upon talking up to the mate as we shall soon see toward evening there was something to be done on deck and the carpenter who belonged to the watch was missing wheres that <unk> chips shouted <unk> down the forecastle scuttle taking his ease dye see down here on a chest if you want to know replied that worthy himself quietly withdrawing his pipe from his mouth this insolence flung the fiery little mate into a mighty rage but beauty said nothing puffing away with all the tranquillity imaginable here it must be remembered that never mind what may be the provocation no prudent officer ever dreams of entering a ships forecastle on a hostile visit if he wants to see anybody who happens to be there and refuses to come up why he must wait patiently until the sailor is willing the reason is this the place is very dark and nothing is easier than to knock one descending on the head before he knows where he is and a very long while before he ever finds out who did it nobody knew this better than <unk> and so he <unk> himself with looking down the scuttle and <unk> at last beauty made some cool observation which set him half wild tumble on deck he then <unk> up with you or ill jump down and make you the carpenter begged him to go about it at once no sooner said than done prudence forgotten <unk> was there and by a sort of instinct had his man by the throat before he could well see him one of the men now made a rush at him but the rest dragged him off <unk> that they should have fair play now come on deck shouted the mate struggling like a good fellow to hold the carpenter fast take me there was the <unk> answer and beauty <unk> about in the nervous grasp of the other like a couple of yards of <unk> his <unk> now <unk> to make him up into a <unk> bundle the more easily to transport him while thus occupied beauty got his arms loose and threw him over backward but <unk> quickly recovered himself when for a time they had it every way dragging each other about <unk> their heads against the projecting beams and returning each others blows the first <unk> opportunity that offered unfortunately <unk> at last slipped and fell his foe seating himself on his chest and keeping him down now this was one of those <unk> in which the voice of counsel or <unk> comes with peculiar <unk> nor did beauty let the opportunity slip but the mate said nothing in reply only foaming at the mouth and struggling to rise just then a thin <unk> of a voice was heard from above it was the captain who happening to ascend to the quarterdeck at the <unk> of the <unk> would gladly have returned to the cabin but was prevented by the fear of <unk> as the din increased and it became evident that his officer was in serious trouble he thought it would never do to stand leaning over the bulwarks so he made his appearance on the forecastle resolved as his best policy to treat the matter lightly why why he begun speaking <unk> and very fast whats all this <unk> <unk> mr <unk> carpenter what are you doing down there come on deck come on deck whereupon doctor long ghost cries out in a <unk> ah miss <unk> is that you now my dear go right home or youll get hurt pooh pooh you sir whoever you are i was not speaking to you none of your nonsense mr <unk> i was talking to you have the kindness to come on deck sir i want to see you and how in the devils name am i to get there cried the mate furiously jump down here captain <unk> and show yourself a man let me up you chips <unk> me i say oh ill pay you for this some day come on captain <unk> at this appeal the poor man was seized with a perfect <unk> of <unk> pooh pooh carpenter have done with your nonsense let him up sir let him up do you hear let mr <unk> come on deck go along with you paper jack replied beauty this <unk> between the mate and me so go aft where you belong as the captain once more dipped his head down the scuttle to make answer from an unseen hand he received full in the face the contents of a tin can of soaked biscuit and <unk> the doctor was not far off just then without waiting for anything more the <unk> gentleman with both hands to his streaming face retreated to the quarterdeck a few moments more and <unk> forced to a <unk> followed after in his torn frock and scarred face looking for all the world as if he had just <unk> himself from some intricate piece of <unk> for about half an hour both remained in the cabin where the mates rough tones were heard high above the low smooth voice of the captain of all his <unk> with the men this was the first in which <unk> had been worsted and he was <unk> enraged upon going <unk> the steward afterward told <unk> <unk> informed <unk> that for the future he might look out for his ship himself for his part he had done with her if that was the way he allowed his officers to be treated after many high words the captain finally assured him that the first <unk> opportunity the carpenter should be cordially flogged though as matters stood the experiment would be a <unk> one upon this <unk> reluctantly <unk> to drop the matter for the present and he soon drowned all thoughts of it in a can of <unk> which <unk> had previously <unk> the steward to prepare as a <unk> to <unk> his wrath nothing more ever came of this chapter v what happened at <unk> less than <unk> hours after leaving nukuheva the blue looming island of st <unk> greeted us from afar drawing near the shore the grim black spars and <unk> hull of a small manofwar craft crept into view the masts and yards lined distinctly against the sky she was <unk> to her anchor in the bay and proved to be a french <unk> this pleased our captain exceedingly and coming on deck he examined her from the mizzen rigging with his glass his original intention was not to let go an anchor but counting upon the assistance of the <unk> in case of any difficulty he now changed his mind and anchored alongside of her as soon as a boat could be lowered he then went off to pay his respects to the commander and moreover as we supposed to concert measures for the apprehension of the <unk> returning in the course of twenty minutes he brought along with him two officers in <unk> and whiskers and three or four <unk> obstreperous old chiefs one with his legs thrust into the <unk> of a <unk> vest another with a pair of spurs on his heels and a third in a cocked hat and feather in addition to these articles they merely wore the ordinary costume of their <unk> slip of native cloth about the loins <unk> as their behaviour was these worthies turned out to be a <unk> from the reverend the <unk> of the island and the object of their visit was to put our ship under a <unk> taboo to prevent the <unk> scenes and <unk> for <unk> which would ensue were the <unk> and <unk> to come off to us freely there was little ceremony about the matter the priests went aside for a moment laid their shaven old crowns together and went over a little <unk> whereupon their leader tore a long strip from his girdle of white tappa and handed it to one of the french officers who after <unk> what was to be done gave it to <unk> the mate at once went out to the end of the flying <unk> boom and fastened there the mystic symbol of the <unk> this put to flight a party of girls who had been observed swimming toward us tossing their arms about and splashing the water like porpoises with loud cries of taboo taboo they turned about and made for the shore the night of our arrival the mate and the <unk> were to stand watch and watch relieving each other every four hours the crew as is sometimes customary when lying at an anchor being allowed to remain all night below a distrust of the men however was in the present instance the principal reason for this proceeding indeed it was all but certain that some kind of attempt would be made at <unk> and therefore when <unk> first watch came on at eight bells <unk> which time all was <unk> mounted to the deck with a flask of spirits in one hand and the other in readiness to <unk> the first countenance that showed itself above the forecastle scuttle thus prepared he doubtless meant to stay awake but for all that he before long fell asleep and slept with such hearty goodwill too that the men who left us that night might have been waked up by his <unk> certain it was the mate <unk> most strangely and no wonder with that crooked <unk> of his when he came to himself it was just dawn but quite light enough to show two boats gone from the side in an instant he knew what had happened dragging the <unk> out of an old sail where he was <unk> he ordered him to clear away another boat and then darted into the cabin to tell the captain the news springing on deck again he drove down into the forecastle for a couple of oarsmen but hardly got there before there was a cry and a loud <unk> heard over the side it was the <unk> and the <unk> which he had just leaped to get ready for <unk> over and over in the water the boat having at nightfall been hoisted up to its place over the starboard quarter <unk> had so cut the tackles which held it there that a moderate strain would at once part them <unk> weight had answered the purpose showing that the <unk> must have <unk> his specific gravity to a <unk> of hemp there was another boat remaining but it was as well to examine it before <unk> to lower and it was well they did for there was a hole in the bottom large enough to drop a barrel through she had been <unk> most <unk> <unk> was frantic dashing his hat upon deck he was about to plunge overboard and swim to the <unk> for a cutter when captain <unk> made his appearance and begged him to stay where he was by this time the officer of the deck aboard the frenchman had noticed our movements and hailed to know what had happened <unk> informed him through his trumpet and men to go in pursuit were instantly promised there was a <unk> of a boatswains pipe an order or two and then a large cutter pulled out from the manofwars stern and in half a dozen strokes was alongside the mate leaped into her and they pulled rapidly ashore another cutter carrying an armed crew soon followed in an hours time the first returned towing the two whaleboats which had been found turned up like tortoises on the beach noon came and nothing more was heard from the <unk> meanwhile doctor long ghost and myself lounged about <unk> an acquaintance and gazing upon the shore scenery the bay was as calm as death the sun high and hot and occasionally a still gliding canoe stole out from behind the <unk> and shot across the water and all the morning long our sick men <unk> about the deck casting <unk> glances inland where the palmtrees waved and beckoned them into their <unk> shades poor invalid rascals how <unk> to the <unk> of their shattered health would have been those delicious groves but hardhearted <unk> assured them with an oath that foot of theirs should never touch the beach toward sunset a crowd was seen coming down to the water in advance of all were the <unk> frocks and <unk> hanging in tatters every face covered with blood and dust and their arms pinioned behind them with green <unk> following them up was a shouting rabble of islanders pricking them with the points of their long spears the party from the <unk> menacing them in flank with their naked cutlasses the <unk> of a musket to the king of the bay and the promise of a <unk> of powder for every man caught had set the whole population on their track and so successful was the hunt that not only were that mornings <unk> brought back but five of those left behind on a former visit the natives however were the mere hounds of the chase raising the game in their <unk> but leaving the securing of it to the <unk> here as elsewhere the islanders have no idea of taking part in such a <unk> as <unk> upon the capture of a party of desperate seamen the <unk> were at once brought aboard and though they looked rather sulky soon came round and treated the whole affair as a <unk> adventure chapter vi we touch at la <unk> fearful of spending another night at <unk> captain <unk> caused the ship to be got under way shortly after dark the next morning when all supposed that we were fairly embarked for a long cruise our course was suddenly altered for la <unk> or <unk> an island just north of the one we had quitted the object of this as we learned was to procure if possible several english sailors who according to the commander of the <unk> had recently gone ashore there from an american whaler and were desirous of shipping aboard one of their own country vessels we made the land in the afternoon coming abreast of a shady glen opening from a deep bay and winding by green <unk> far out of sight hands by the <unk> roared the mate jumping up on the bulwarks and in a moment the <unk> <unk> suddenly arrested in her course <unk> her head like a steed <unk> in while the foam <unk> under her bows this was the place where we expected to obtain the men so a boat was at once got in readiness to go ashore now it was necessary to provide a picked <unk> the least likely to <unk> after considerable <unk> on the part of the captain and mate four of the seamen were pitched upon as the most trustworthy or rather they were selected from a choice <unk> of suspicious characters as being of an inferior order of <unk> armed with cutlasses all <unk> natives were said to be an ugly <unk> were followed over the side by the invalid captain who on this occasion it seems was determined to <unk> himself accordingly in addition to his cutlass he wore an old boarding belt in which was thrust a brace of pistols they at once shoved off my friend long ghost had among other things which looked somewhat strange in a ships forecastle a capital spyglass and on the present occasion we had it in use when the boat neared the head of the <unk> though invisible to the naked eye it was plainly revealed by the glass looking no <unk> than an <unk> and the men diminished to <unk> at last borne on what seemed a long <unk> of foam the tiny craft shot up the beach amid a shower of sparkles not a soul was there leaving one of their number by the water the rest of the <unk> stepped ashore looking about them very <unk> pausing now and then hand to ear and peering under a dense grove which swept down within a few paces of the sea no one came and to all appearances everything was as still as the grave presently he with the pistols followed by the rest flourishing their <unk> entered the wood and were soon lost to view they did not stay long probably <unk> some <unk> <unk> were they to stray any distance up the glen in a few moments they embarked again and were soon <unk> <unk> over the waves of the bay all of a sudden the captain started to his <unk> boat spun round and again made for the shore some twenty or thirty natives armed with spears which through the glass looked like <unk> had just come out of the grove and were apparently shouting to the strangers not to be in such a hurry but return and be sociable but they were somewhat <unk> for the boat paused about its length from the beach when the captain standing up in its head delivered an address in <unk> the object of which seemed to be that the islanders should draw near one of them stepped forward and made answer seemingly again urging the strangers not to be <unk> but beach their boat the captain declined tossing his arms about in another <unk> in the end he said something which made them shake their spears whereupon he fired a pistol among them which set the whole party running while one poor little fellow dropping his spear and clapping his hand behind him <unk> away in a manner which almost made me <unk> to get a shot at his <unk> <unk> acts of cruelty like this are not unusual on the part of sea captains landing at islands comparatively unknown even at the <unk> group but a days sail from tahiti the islanders coming down to the shore have several times been fired at by <unk> <unk> passing through their narrow channels and this too as a mere <unk> on the part of the <unk> indeed it is almost incredible the light in which many sailors regard these naked heathens they hardly consider them human but it is a curious fact that the more ignorant and degraded men are the more <unk> they look upon those whom they deem their <unk> all powers of persuasion being thus lost upon these foolish savages and no hope left of holding further intercourse the boat returned to the ship chapter vii what happened at <unk> on the other side of the island was the large and populous bay of <unk> where the men sought might yet be found but as the sun was setting by the time the boat came alongside we got our <unk> <unk> aboard and stood away for an <unk> about daybreak we wore and ran in and by the time the sun was well up entered the long narrow channel dividing the islands of la <unk> and st <unk> on one hand was a range of steep green bluffs hundreds of feet high the white <unk> of the natives here and there <unk> like birds nests in deep clefts <unk> with verdure across the water the land rolled away in bright hillsides so warm and undulating that they seemed almost to <unk> in the sun on we swept past bluff and grove wooded glen and valley and dark <unk> lighted up far inland with wild falls of water a fresh <unk> filled our sails the <unk> waters were gentle as a lake and every wave broke with a <unk> against our <unk> prow on gaining the end of the channel we rounded a point and came full upon the bay of <unk> this is the only harbour of any note about the island though as far as a safe anchorage is concerned it hardly deserves the title before we held any communication with the shore an incident occurred which may convey some further idea of the character of our crew having approached as near the land as we could <unk> our headway was stopped and we awaited the arrival of a canoe which was coming out of the bay all at once we got into a strong current which swept us rapidly toward a rocky promontory forming one side of the harbour the wind had died away so two boats were at once lowered for the purpose of pulling the ships head round before this could be done the eddies were whirling upon all sides and the rock so near that it seemed as if one might leap upon it from the masthead notwithstanding the speechless fright of the captain and the hoarse shouts of the <unk> <unk> the men handled the ropes as deliberately as possible some of them <unk> at the prospect of going ashore and others so eager for the vessel to strike that they could hardly contain themselves unexpectedly a <unk> <unk> us and assisted by the boats we were soon out of danger what a disappointment for our crew all their little plans for swimming ashore from the wreck and having a fine time of it for the rest of their days thus <unk> <unk> in the bud soon after the canoe came alongside in it were eight or ten natives comely <unk> youths all gesture and exclamation the red feathers in their <unk> perpetually nodding with them also came a stranger a <unk> from christendom and <unk> white man in the south sea girdle and tattooed in the face a broad blue band stretched across his face from ear to ear and on his forehead was the <unk> figure of a blue shark nothing but fins from head to tail some of us gazed upon this man with a feeling akin to horror no ways abated when informed that he had voluntarily submitted to this <unk> of his countenance what an impress far worse than <unk> was perhaps a <unk> or a <unk> which some of our modern <unk> might have <unk> but the blue shark was a mark <unk> which all the waters of <unk> and <unk> rivers of <unk> could never wash out he was an englishman <unk> hardy he called himself who had deserted from a <unk> brig touching at the island for wood and water some ten years previous he had gone ashore as a sovereign power armed with a musket and a bag of <unk> and ready if need were to <unk> war on his own account the country was divided by the hostile kings of several large valleys with one of them from whom he first received <unk> he formed an alliance and became what he now was the military leader of the tribe and <unk> of the entire island his <unk> beat <unk> in one night attack his invincible musket backed by the light <unk> of spears and javelins vanquished two <unk> and the next morning brought all the others to the feet of his royal <unk> nor was the rise of his domestic fortunes at all behind the <unk> three days after landing the <unk> tattooed hand of a <unk> was his receiving along with the damsel as her portion one thousand fathoms of fine tappa fifty <unk> mats of split grass four hundred hogs ten houses in different parts of her native valley and the sacred protection of an express <unk> of the taboo declaring his person <unk> for ever now this man was settled for life perfectly satisfied with his circumstances and feeling no desire to return to his friends friends indeed he had none he told me his history thrown upon the world a <unk> his paternal origin was as much a mystery to him as the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> by everybody he fled the <unk> <unk> when a boy and launched upon the sea he had followed it for several years a dog before the mast and now he had thrown it up for ever and for the most part it is just this sort of <unk> many of whom are found among <unk> for by a single soul without ties reckless and impatient of the <unk> of civilization who are occasionally found quite at home upon the savage islands of the pacific and glancing at their hard lot in their own country what marvel at their choice according to the <unk> there was no other white man on the island and as the captain could have no reason to suppose that hardy intended to deceive us he concluded that the <unk> were in some way or other mistaken in what they had told us however when our errand was made known to the rest of our visitors one of them a fine stalwart fellow his face all eyes and expression volunteered for a cruise all the wages he asked was a red shirt a pair of <unk> and a hat which were to be put on there and then besides a plug of tobacco and a pipe the <unk> was struck directly but <unk> afterward came in with a <unk> to the effect that a friend of his who had come along with him should be given ten whole <unk> without crack or <unk> twenty perfectly new and <unk> straight nails and one jackknife this being agreed to the articles were at once handed over the native receiving them with great <unk> and in the absence of clothing using his mouth as a pocket to put the nails in two of them however were first made to take the place of a pair of <unk> curiously fashioned out of bits of <unk> wood it now began <unk> strongly from seaward and no time was to be lost in getting away from the land so after an affecting rubbing of noses between our new shipmate and his countrymen we sailed away with him to our surprise the farewell shouts from the canoe as we dashed along under <unk> royals were heard <unk> by our islander but it was not long thus that very evening when the dark blue of his native hills sunk in the horizon the poor savage leaned over the bulwarks dropped his head upon his chest and gave way to <unk> emotions the ship was plunging hard and <unk> sad to tell in addition to his other pangs was <unk> <unk> chapter viii the <unk> of la <unk> for a while leaving little <unk> to sail away by herself i will here put down some curious information obtained from hardy the <unk> had lived so long on the island that its customs were quite familiar and i much lamented that from the <unk> of our stay he could not tell us more than he did from the little intelligence gathered however i learned to my surprise that in some things the people of <unk> though of the same group of islands <unk> considerably from my tropical friends in the valley of typee as his tattooing attracted so much remark hardy had a good deal to say concerning the manner in which that art was practised upon the island throughout the entire cluster the <unk> of <unk> enjoyed no small reputation they had carried their art to the highest perfection and the profession was esteemed most honourable no wonder then that like genteel tailors they <unk> their services very high so much so that none but those belonging to the higher classes could afford to employ them so true was this that the <unk> of ones tattooing was in most cases a sure <unk> of birth and <unk> <unk> in large practice lived in spacious houses divided by <unk> of tappa into numerous little apartments where subjects were waited upon in private the arrangement chiefly grew out of a singular <unk> of the taboo which enjoined the <unk> privacy upon all men high and low while under the hands of a <unk> for the time the slightest intercourse with others is prohibited and the small portion of food allowed is pushed under the curtain by an unseen hand the <unk> with regard to food is intended to <unk> the blood so as to diminish the <unk> consequent upon <unk> the skin as it is this comes on very soon and takes some time to <unk> so that the period of seclusion generally embraces many days sometimes several weeks all traces of <unk> vanished the subject goes abroad but only again to return for on account of the pain only a small surface can be operated upon at once and as the whole body is to be more or less embellished by a process so slow the <unk> alluded to are constantly filled indeed with a vanity elsewhere unheard of many spend no small portion of their days thus sitting to an artist to begin the work the period of <unk> is esteemed the most suitable after casting about for some eminent <unk> the friends of the youth take him to his house to have the <unk> of the general plan laid out it <unk> the professor to have a nice eye for a suit to be worn for life should be well cut some <unk> yearning after perfection employ at large wages one or two men of the <unk> <unk> fellows utterly regardless of appearances upon whom they first try their <unk> and <unk> generally their backs remorselessly <unk> over and no more canvas remaining they are dismissed and ever after go about the scorn of their countrymen hapless <unk> thus <unk> in the cause of the fine arts beside the regular <unk> there are a parcel of shabby <unk> <unk> who by virtue of their calling stroll unmolested from one hostile bay to another doing their work <unk> for the multitude they always repair to the various religious <unk> which gather great crowds when these are concluded and the places where they are held <unk> even by the <unk> scores of little tents of coarse tappa are left standing each with a solitary inmate who forbidden to talk to his unseen <unk> is obliged to stay there till completely healed the <unk> are a reproach to their profession mere <unk> <unk> in nothing but jagged lines and clumsy patches and utterly incapable of soaring to those heights of fancy attained by the gentlemen of the <unk> all <unk> of the arts love to <unk> and so in <unk> the <unk> came together in the chapters of their worshipful order in this society duly <unk> and <unk> degrees hardy from his influence as a white was a sort of <unk> grand master the blue shark and a sort of <unk> and <unk> <unk> upon his chest were the seal of his <unk> all over <unk> are established these orders of <unk> the way in which the <unk> came to be founded is this a year or two after his landing there happened to be a season of <unk> owing to the partial failure of the breadfruit harvest for several <unk> seasons this brought about such a falling off in the number of subjects for tattooing that the profession became quite needy the royal <unk> of hardy however hit upon a benevolent <unk> to provide for their wants at the same time <unk> a boon upon many of his subjects by sound of <unk> it was proclaimed before the palace on the beach and at the head of the valley that <unk> king of <unk> and friend of <unk> the white kept open heart and table for all <unk> whatsoever but to <unk> themselves to this hospitality they were commanded to <unk> without <unk> upon the meanest native <unk> their services numbers at once <unk> to the royal abode both artists and <unk> it was a famous time and the buildings of the palace being taboo to all but the <unk> and chiefs the <unk> <unk> on the common and formed an extensive <unk> the <unk> <unk> or the time of tattooing will be long remembered an enthusiastic <unk> celebrated the event in verse several lines were repeated to us by hardy some of which in a sort of <unk> chant he translated nearly thus where is that sound in <unk> and wherefore that sound the sound of a hundred hammers tapping tapping tapping the shark teeth where is that light round about the kings house and the small laughter the small merry laughter it is of the sons and daughters of the tattooed chapter ix we steer to the <unk> of affairs the night we left <unk> was bright and starry and so warm that when the watches were relieved most of the men instead of going below flung themselves around the foremast toward morning finding the heat of the forecastle unpleasant i ascended to the deck where everything was noiseless the trades were blowing with a mild steady strain upon the canvas and the ship heading right out into the immense blank of the western pacific the watch were asleep with one foot resting on the <unk> even the man at the helm nodded and the mate himself with arms folded was leaning against the capstan on such a night and all alone reverie was inevitable i leaned over the side and could not help thinking of the strange objects we might be sailing over but my meditations were soon interrupted by a gray <unk> shadow cast over the heaving billows it was the dawn soon followed by the first rays of the morning they flashed into view at one end of the arched night <unk> compare great things with <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> lantern in the vaults of the parliament house before long what seemed a live <unk> rested for a moment on the rim of the ocean and at last the <unk> sun stood full and round in the level east and the long <unk> began breakfast over the first thing attended to was the formal <unk> of <unk> who after thinking over his affairs during the night looked dismal enough there were various opinions as to a suitable appellation some maintained that we ought to call him sunday that being the day we caught him others eighteen <unk> the then year of our lord while doctor long ghost remarked that he ought by all means to retain his original <unk> meaning as he maintained in the <unk> language of the island something <unk> to one who had got himself into a scrape the mate put an end to the discussion by <unk> the poor fellow with a bucket of salt water and <unk> upon him the nautical appellation of luff though a certain <unk> succeeded his first pangs at leaving home <unk> will call him <unk> <unk> into his former mood and became very melancholy often i noticed him crouching apart in the forecastle his strange eyes gleaming <unk> and watching the slightest movement of the men many a time he must have been thinking of his bamboo hut when they were talking of <unk> and its <unk> we were now fairly at sea though to what particular <unk> we were going no one knew and to all appearances few cared the men after a fashion of their own began to settle down into the <unk> of <unk> as if everything was going on <unk> blown along over a smooth sea there was nothing to do but steer the ship and relieve the lookouts at the mastheads as for the sick they had two or three more added to their <unk> air of the island having <unk> with the <unk> of several of the <unk> to crown all the captain again <unk> and became quite ill the men fit for duty were divided into two small watches headed respectively by the mate and the <unk> the latter by virtue of his being a <unk> succeeding to the place of the second mate who had <unk> in this state of things whaling was out of the question but in the face of everything <unk> maintained that the invalids would soon be well however that might be with the same pale hue sky overhead we kept running steadily to the westward forever advancing we seemed always in the same place and every day was the former lived over again we saw no ships expected to see none no sign of life was perceptible but the porpoises and other fish sporting under the bows like <unk> ashore but at intervals the gray albatross peculiar to these seas came <unk> his immense wings over us and then <unk> away silently as if from a <unk> or flights of the tropic bird known among seamen as the boatswain wheeled round and round us <unk> <unk> as they flew the uncertainty hanging over our destination at this time and the fact that we were abroad upon waters comparatively little traversed lent an interest to this portion of the cruise which i shall never forget from obvious <unk> considerations the pacific has been principally sailed over in known <unk> and this is the reason why new islands are still occasionally discovered by exploring ships and adventurous whalers notwithstanding the great number of vessels of all kinds of late <unk> this vast ocean indeed considerable portions still remain wholly <unk> and there is doubt as to the actual existence of certain shoals and reefs and small clusters of islands vaguely laid down in the charts the mere circumstance therefore of a ship like ours penetrating into these regions was sufficient to cause any <unk> mind to feel at least a little uneasy for my own part the many stories i had heard of ships striking at midnight upon unknown rocks with all sail set and a slumbering crew often recurred to me especially as from the absence of discipline and our being so <unk> the watches at night were careless in the extreme but no thoughts like these were entertained by my reckless shipmates and along we went the sun every evening setting right ahead of our <unk> boom for what reason the mate was so reserved with regard to our precise destination was never made known the stories he told us i for one did not believe deeming them all a mere device to lull the crew he said we were bound to a fine cruising ground scarcely known to other whalemen which he had himself discovered when commanding a small brig upon a former voyage here the sea was alive with large whales so tame that all you had to do was to go up and kill them they were too frightened to resist a little to leeward of this was a small cluster of islands where we were going to <unk> abounding with delicious fruits and peopled by a race almost wholly unsophisticated by intercourse with strangers in order perhaps to guard against the possibility of <unk> finding out the precise latitude and longitude of the spot we were going to <unk> never revealed to us the ships place at noon though such is the custom aboard of most vessels meanwhile he was very <unk> in his attention to the invalids doctor long ghost having given up the keys of the <unk> they were handed over to him and as physician he discharged his duties to the satisfaction of all pills and <unk> in most cases were thrown to the fish and in place thereof the contents of a mysterious little quarter cask were produced <unk> with water from the <unk> his <unk> were mixed on the capstan in cocoanut shells marked with the <unk> names like shore doctors he did not <unk> his own <unk> for his professional calls in the forecastle were sometimes made when he was <unk> <unk> nor did he omit keeping his invalids in <unk> spinning his yarns to them by the hour whenever he went to see them owing to my <unk> from which i soon began to recover i did no active duty except standing an occasional trick at the helm it was in the forecastle chiefly that i spent my time in company with the long doctor who was at great pains to make himself agreeable his books though sadly torn and tattered were an invaluable resource i read them through again and again including a learned treatise on the yellow fever in addition to these he had an old file of <unk> papers and i soon became <unk> acquainted with the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> there in particular the <unk> <unk> of stubbs the <unk> auctioneer diverted me exceedingly and i set him down as no other than a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> aside from the pleasure of his society my <unk> with long ghost was of great service to me in other respects his disgrace in the cabin only confirmed the goodwill of the democracy in the forecastle and they not only treated him in the most friendly manner but looked up to him with the utmost deference besides laughing heartily at all his jokes as his chosen associate this feeling for him extended to me and gradually we came to be regarded in the light of distinguished guests at <unk> we were always first served and otherwise were treated with much respect among other devices to kill time during the frequent calms long ghost hit upon the game of <unk> with a jackknife we carved the pieces quite <unk> out of bits of wood and our board was the middle of a <unk> <unk> into squares which in playing we <unk> at either end having no other suitable way of <unk> the sets i marked mine by <unk> round them little <unk> of black silk torn from an old <unk> putting them in mourning this way the doctor said was quite appropriate seeing that they had reason to feel sad three games out of four of <unk> the men never could make head nor tail indeed their wonder rose to such a pitch that they at last regarded the mysterious movements of the game with something more than perplexity and after puzzling over them through several long <unk> they came to the conclusion that we must be a couple of <unk> chapter x a <unk> described with some of its tenants i might as well give some idea of the place in which the doctor and i lived together so sociably most persons know that a ships forecastle embraces the forward part of the deck about the bowsprit the same term however is generally bestowed upon the sailors <unk> which occupy a space immediately beneath and are <unk> off by a bulkhead planted right in the bows or as sailors say in the very eyes of the ship this delightful apartment is of a triangular shape and is generally fitted with two tiers of rude <unk> those of the <unk> were in a most deplorable condition mere wrecks some having been torn down altogether to patch up others and on one side there were but two standing but with most of the men it made little difference whether they had a <unk> or not since having no <unk> they had nothing to put in it but themselves upon the boards of my own <unk> i spread all the old canvas and old clothes i could pick up for a pillow i wrapped an old jacket round a log this helped a little the wear and tear of ones bones when the ship rolled rude hammocks made out of old sails were in many cases used as <unk> for the <unk> <unk> but the space they swung in was so confined that they were far from being agreeable the general aspect of the forecastle was <unk> and <unk> in the extreme in the first place it was not five feet from deck to deck and even this space was <unk> upon by two outlandish <unk> bracing the vessel and by the sailors chests over which you must needs crawl in getting about at <unk> and especially when we indulged in <unk> chat we sat about the chests like a parcel of tailors in the middle of all were two square wooden columns denominated in marine <unk> bowsprit <unk> they were about a foot apart and between them by a rusty chain swung the forecastle lamp burning day and night and forever casting two long black shadows lower down between the <unk> was a locker or sailors pantry kept in abominable disorder and sometimes requiring a vigorous <unk> and <unk> all over the ship was in a most dilapidated condition but in the forecastle it looked like the hollow of an old tree going to decay in every direction the wood was damp and <unk> and here and there soft and <unk> moreover it was <unk> and <unk> without mercy the cook frequently helping himself to splinters for <unk> from the <unk> and beams overhead every <unk> was sooty and here and there deep holes were burned in them a <unk> of some <unk> sailors on a voyage long previous from above you entered by a plank with two <unk> slanting down from the scuttle which was a mere hole in the deck there being no slide to draw over in case of <unk> the tarpaulin temporarily placed there was little protection from the spray heaved over the bows so that in anything of a breeze the place was miserably wet in a squall the water fairly poured down in sheets like a cascade <unk> about and afterward <unk> up between the chests like the jets of a fountain such were our <unk> aboard of the <unk> but bad as they were we had not the <unk> possession of them myriads of <unk> and regiments of <unk> <unk> the place with us a greater calamity than this can scarcely befall a vessel in the south seas so warm is the climate that it is almost impossible to get rid of them you may seal up every hatchway and <unk> the hull till the smoke forces itself out at the seams and enough will survive to <unk> the ship in an <unk> short period in some vessels the crews of which after a hard fight have given themselves up as it were for lost the <unk> seem to take actual possession the sailors being mere tenants by <unk> with sperm whalemen hanging about the line as many of them do for a couple of years on a stretch it is infinitely worse than with other vessels as for the <unk> these creatures never had such free and easy times as they did in her crazy old hull every <unk> and <unk> <unk> with them they did not live among you but you among them so true was this that the business of eating and drinking was better done in the dark than in the light of day concerning the <unk> there was an extraordinary phenomenon for which none of us could ever account every night they had a <unk> the first <unk> was an unusual clustering and humming among the swarms <unk> the beams overhead and the inside of the <unk> this was succeeded by a prodigious coming and going on the part of those living out of sight presently they all came forth the larger sort <unk> over the chests and planks winged monsters darting to and fro in the air and the small fry <unk> in heaps almost in a state of <unk> on the first alarm all who were able darted on deck while some of the sick who were too feeble lay perfectly <unk> distracted <unk> running over them at pleasure the performance lasted some ten minutes during which no <unk> ever hummed louder often it was lamented by us that the time of the <unk> could never be predicted it was liable to come upon us at any hour of the night and what a relief it was when it happened to fall in the early part of the evening nor must i forget the <unk> they did not forget me tame as <unk> <unk> they stood in their holes peering at you like old <unk> in a <unk> often they darted in upon us at <unk> and <unk> our food the first time they approached <unk> he was actually frightened but becoming accustomed to it he soon got along with them much better than the rest with curious <unk> he seized the animals by their legs and flung them up the scuttle to find a watery grave but i have a story of my own to tell about these <unk> one day the cabin steward made me a present of some <unk> which i was so choice of that i kept it hid away in a tin can in the farthest corner of my <unk> <unk> as we did this <unk> dropped upon a biscuit was a positive luxury which i shared with none but the doctor and then only in private and sweet as the <unk> was how could bread thus prepared and eaten in secret be otherwise than pleasant one night our precious can ran low and in <unk> it over in the dark something beside the <unk> slipped out how long it had been there kind providence never revealed nor were we over anxious to know for we hushed up the bare thought as quickly as possible the creature certainly died a <unk> death quite equal to <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> chapter xi doctor long ghost a <unk> of his <unk> grave though he was at times doctor long ghost was a decided wag <unk> knows what lovers of fun sailors are <unk> they are absolutely mad after it so his <unk> were duly <unk> the poor old black cook <unk> his hammock for the night and finding a wet log fast asleep in it and then waking in the morning with his <unk> head <unk> opening his coppers and finding an old boot boiling away as <unk> as could be and sometimes cakes of pitch <unk> in his oven <unk> tribulations were indeed sore there was no peace for him day nor night poor fellow he was altogether too goodnatured say what they will about <unk> people it is far better on some accounts to have the temper of a <unk> whoever thought of taking <unk> with <unk> black dan the most curious of the doctors jokes was hoisting the men aloft by the foot or shoulder when they fell asleep on deck during the nightwatches ascending from the forecastle on one occasion he found every soul <unk> and forthwith went about his <unk> fastening a ropes end to each sleeper he rove the lines through a number of blocks and conducted them all to the windlass then by heaving round <unk> in spite of cries and struggles he soon had them dangling aloft in all directions by arms and legs waked by the uproar we rushed up from below and found the poor fellows swinging in the moonlight from the tops and lower yardarms like a parcel of pirates <unk> at sea by a <unk> connected with this sort of diversion was another <unk> of his during the night some of those on deck would come below to light a pipe or take a mouthful of beef and biscuit sometimes they fell asleep and being missed directly that anything was to be done their shipmates often <unk> themselves by running them aloft with a <unk> dropped down the scuttle from the foretop one night when all was perfectly still i lay awake in the forecastle the lamp was burning low and thick and swinging from its <unk> beam and with the uniform motion of the ship the men in the <unk> rolled slowly from side to side the hammocks swaying in <unk> presently i heard a foot upon the ladder and looking up saw a wide <unk> leg immediately navy <unk> a stout old <unk> <unk> descended and at once went to groping in the locker after something to eat supper ended he proceeded to load his pipe now for a good comfortable smoke at sea there never was a better place than the <unk> forecastle at midnight to enjoy the luxury one wants to fall into a kind of dreamy reverie only known to the children of the weed and the very atmosphere of the place laden as it was with the <unk> of the sleepers was <unk> of this no wonder then that after a while <unk> head sunk upon his breast presently his hat fell off the extinguished pipe dropped from his mouth and the next moment he lay out on the chest as tranquil as an infant suddenly an order was heard on deck followed by the trampling of feet and the hauling of rigging the yards were being braced and soon after the sleeper was missed for there was a whispered <unk> over the scuttle directly a shadow glided across the forecastle and noiselessly approached the <unk> <unk> it was one of the watch with the end of a rope leading out of sight up the scuttle pausing an instant the sailor pressed softly the chest of his victim sounding his slumbers and then <unk> the cord to his <unk> returned to the deck hardly was his back turned when a long limb was thrust from a hammock opposite and doctor long ghost leaping forth <unk> whipped the rope from <unk> <unk> and fastened it like lightning to a great <unk> chest the property of the man who had just disappeared scarcely was the thing done when lo with a thundering bound the clumsy box was torn from its <unk> and <unk> from side to side flew toward the scuttle here it jammed and thinking that <unk> who was as strong as a windlass was <unk> a beam and trying to cut the line the <unk> on deck strained away furiously on a sudden the chest went aloft and striking against the mast flew open <unk> down on the heads of a party the <unk> shower of things too numerous to mention of course the uproar roused all hands and when we hurried on deck there was the owner of the box looking aghast at its scattered contents and with one wandering hand taking the <unk> of a <unk> on his head chapter xii death and burial of two of the crew the <unk> which at times reigned among us was in strange and shocking contrast with the situation of some of the invalids thus at least did it seem to me though not to others but an event occurred about this period which in removing by far the most pitiable cases of suffering tended to make less grating to my feelings the subsequent conduct of the crew we had been at sea about twenty days when two of the sick who had rapidly grown worse died one night within an hour of each other one occupied a <unk> right next to mine and for several days had not risen from it during this period he was often delirious starting up and glaring around him and sometimes wildly tossing his arms on the night of his decease i retired shortly after the middle watch began and waking from a vague dream of horrors felt something <unk> resting on me it was the sick mans hand two or three times during the evening previous he had thrust it into my <unk> and i had quietly removed it but now i started and flung it from me the arm fell stark and stiff and i knew that he was dead waking the men the corpse was immediately rolled up in the strips of <unk> upon which it lay and carried on deck the mate was then called and preparations made for an <unk> burial laying the body out on the <unk> it was <unk> up in one of the hammocks some <unk> being placed at the feet instead of shot this done it was borne to the gangway and placed on a plank laid across the bulwarks two men supported the inside end by way of solemnity the ships headway was then stopped by hauling <unk> the maintopsail the mate who was far from being sober then staggered up and holding on to a shroud gave the word as the plank <unk> the body slid off slowly and fell with a <unk> into the sea a bubble or two and nothing more was seen brace forward the mainyard swung round to its place and the ship glided on whilst the corpse perhaps was still sinking we had tossed a shipmate to the sharks but no one would have thought it to have gone among the crew immediately after the dead man had been a <unk> <unk> fellow while alive and no favourite and now that he was no more little thought was bestowed upon him all that was said was concerning the <unk> of his chest which having been always kept locked was supposed to contain money <unk> volunteered to break it open and <unk> its contents clothing and all before the captain should demand it while myself and others were endeavouring to <unk> them from this all started at a cry from the forecastle there could be no one there but two of the sick unable to crawl on deck we went below and found one of them dying on a chest he had fallen out of his hammock in a fit and was insensible the eyes were open and fixed and his breath coming and going <unk> the men shrunk from him but the doctor taking his hand held it a few moments in his and suddenly letting it fall exclaimed hes gone the body was instantly borne up the ladder another hammock was soon prepared and the dead sailor <unk> up as before some additional ceremony however was now insisted upon and a bible was called for but none was to be had not even a prayer book when this was made known <unk> a portuguese from the <unk> islands stepped up muttering something over the corpse of his countryman and with his finger described upon the back of the hammock the figure of a large cross whereupon it received the <unk> these two men both perished from the <unk> <unk> of seamen heightened by circumstances apparent but had either of them been ashore under proper treatment he would in all human probability have recovered behold here the fate of a sailor they give him the last toss and no one <unk> whose child he was for the rest of that night there was no more sleep many stayed on deck until broad morning relating to each other those marvellous tales of the sea which the occasion was calculated to call forth little as i believed in such things i could not listen to some of these stories unaffected above all was i struck by one of the carpenters on a voyage to india they had a fever aboard which carried off nearly half the crew in the space of a few days after this the men never went aloft in the <unk> except in <unk> when topsails were to be <unk> phantoms were seen at the yardarm ends and in tacking ship voices called aloud from the tops the carpenter himself going with another man to furl the <unk> in a squall was nearly pushed from the rigging by an unseen hand and his shipmate swore that a wet hammock was <unk> in his face stories like these were related as <unk> truths by those who declared themselves <unk> it is a circumstance not generally known perhaps that among ignorant seamen <unk> or <unk> as they are more commonly called are regarded with peculiar superstition for some reason or other which i never could get at they are supposed to possess the gift of second sight and the power to <unk> supernatural vengeance upon those who <unk> them on this account they have great influence among sailors and two or three with whom i have sailed at different times were persons well calculated to produce this sort of impression at least upon minds disposed to believe in such things now we had one of these <unk> aboard an old <unk> fellow who always wore a rude <unk> cap of his own make and carried his tobacco in a large pouch made of the same stuff van as we called him was a quiet <unk> man to look at and among such a set his occasional peculiarities had hitherto passed for nothing at this time however he came out with a <unk> which was none the less remarkable from its absolute <unk> though not exactly in the spirit in which it was given out the night of the burial he laid his hand on the old <unk> nailed as a charm to the foremast and solemnly told us that in less than three weeks not one quarter of our number would remain aboard the <unk> that time they would have left her for ever some laughed flash jack called him an old fool but among the men generally it produced a marked effect for several days a degree of quiet reigned among us and allusions of such a kind were made to recent events as could be attributed to no other cause than the <unk> omen for my own part what had lately come to pass was not without its influence it forcibly brought to mind our really critical condition doctor long ghost too frequently revealed his apprehensions and once assured me that he would give much to be safely landed upon any island around us where we were exactly no one but the mate seemed to know nor whither we were going the <unk> mere <unk> an invalid in his cabin to say nothing more of so many of his men <unk> in the forecastle our keeping the sea under these circumstances a matter strange enough at first now seemed wholly <unk> and added to all was the thought that our fate was absolutely in the hand of the reckless <unk> were anything to happen to him we would be left without a navigator for according to <unk> himself he had from the <unk> of the voyage always kept the ships reckoning the captains nautical knowledge being <unk> but considerations like these strange as it may seem seldom or never occurred to the crew they were alive only to superstitious fears and when in apparent <unk> to the <unk> prophecy the sick men rallied a little they began to recover their former spirits and the recollection of what had occurred insensibly faded from their minds in a weeks time the <unk> of little <unk> as a sea vessel always a subject of <unk> now became more so than ever in the forecastle flash jack with his knife often dug into the <unk> rotten planks ribbed between us and death and flung away the splinters with some sea joke as to the remaining invalids they were hardly ill enough to occasion any serious apprehension at least for the present in the breasts of such <unk> beings as themselves and even those who suffered the most <unk> refrained from any expression of pain the truth is that among sailors as a class sickness at sea is so heartily <unk> and the sick so little cared for that the greatest invalid generally <unk> to mask his sufferings he has given no sympathy to others and he <unk> none in return their conduct in this respect so opposed to their <unk> behaviour ashore painfully <unk> the landsman on his first intercourse with them as a sailor sometimes but seldom our invalids <unk> against their being kept at sea where they could be of no service when they ought to be ashore and in the way of <unk> <unk> cheer <unk> up my <unk> mate would say and after this fashion he put a stop to their <unk> but there was one circumstance to which <unk> i have but barely alluded that tended more than anything else to <unk> many to their situation this was the receiving regularly twice every day a certain portion of <unk> which was served out at the capstan by the steward in little tin measures called <unk> the lively affection seamen have for strong drink is well known but in the south seas where it is so seldom to be had a <unk> sailor <unk> scarcely any price too dear which will purchase his <unk> tot nowadays american whalemen in the pacific never think of carrying spirits as a <unk> and aboard of most of them it is never served out even in times of the greatest hardships all <unk> whalemen however still cling to the old custom and carry it as a part of the regular supplies for the voyage in port the allowance of <unk> was suspended with a view undoubtedly of <unk> the <unk> of being out of sight of land now owing to the absence of proper discipline our sick in addition to what they took <unk> often came in for their respective <unk> <unk> and added to all this the evening of the last day of the week was always celebrated by what is styled on board of english vessels the <unk> bottles two of these were sent down into the forecastle just after dark one for the starboard watch and the other for the larboard by <unk> the oldest seaman in each claims the treat as his and accordingly <unk> out the good cheer and passes it round like a lord doing the honours of his table but the <unk> bottles were not all the carpenter and cooper in sea <unk> chips and <unk> who were the <unk> or leaders of the forecastle in some way or other managed to obtain an extra supply which perpetually kept them in fine <unk> spirits and moreover disposed them to look <unk> upon a state of affairs like the present but where were the sperm whales all this time in good sooth it made little matter where they were since we were in no condition to capture them about this time indeed the men came down from the mastheads where until now they had kept up the form of relieving each other every two hours they swore they would go there no more upon this the mate carelessly observed that they would soon be where lookouts were entirely unnecessary the whales he had in his eye though flash jack said they were all in his being so tame that they made a practice of coming round ships and <unk> their backs against them thus went the world of waters with us some four weeks or more after leaving <unk> chapter xiii our destination changed it was not long after the death of the two men that captain <unk> was reported as fast <unk> and in a day or two more as dying the doctor who previously had refused to enter the cabin upon any consideration now <unk> and paid his old enemy a professional visit he prescribed a warm bath which was thus prepared the skylight being removed a cask was lowered down into the cabin and then filled with <unk> of water from the ships coppers the cries of the patient when dipped into his rude bath were most painful to hear they at last laid him on the transom more dead than alive that evening the mate was perfectly sober and coming forward to the windlass where we were lounging summoned aft the doctor myself and two or three others of his <unk> when in the presence of <unk> the <unk> he spoke to us thus i have something to say to ye men theres none but <unk> here as belongs aft so ive picked ye out as the best men <unk> to take counsel with dye see <unk> the ship the captains anchor is pretty nigh <unk> i shouldnt wonder if he <unk> afore morning so whats to be done if we have to <unk> him up some of those pirates there <unk> may take it into their heads to run off with the ship because theres no one at the tiller now ive <unk> whats best to be done but i dont want to do it unless ive good men to back me and make things all fair and square if ever we get home again we all asked what his plan was ill tell ye what it is men if the skipper dies all agree to obey my orders and in less than three weeks ill engage to have five hundred barrels of sperm oil under hatches enough to give every mothers son of ye a handful of dollars when we get to <unk> if ye dont agree to this ye wont have a <unk> coming to ye doctor long ghost at once broke in he said that such a thing was not to be <unk> of that if the captain died the mate was in duty bound to <unk> the ship to the nearest civilized port and deliver her up into an english <unk> hands when in all probability after a run ashore the crew would be sent home everything forbade the mates plan still said he assuming an air of indifference if the men say stick it out stick it out say i but in that case the sooner we get to those islands of yours the better something more he went on to say and from the manner in which the rest regarded him it was plain that our fate was in his hands it was finally resolved upon that if captain <unk> was no better in twentyfour hours the ships head should be pointed for the island of tahiti this announcement produced a strong <unk> sick <unk> the rest <unk> as to what was next to befall us while the doctor without <unk> to <unk> <unk> me upon the prospect of soon beholding a place so famous as the island in question the night after the holding of the <unk> i happened to go on deck in the middle watch and found the yards braced sharp up on the larboard tack with the south east trades strong on our bow the captain was no better and we were off for tahiti chapter xiv rope yarn while gliding along on our way i cannot well omit some account of a poor devil we had among us who went by the name of rope yarn or <unk> he was a <unk> who had joined the ship as a landsman being so <unk> timid and <unk> it was thought useless to try and make a sailor of him so he was translated into the cabin as steward the man previously filling that post a good seaman going among the crew and taking his place but poor <unk> proved quite as clumsy among the <unk> as in the rigging and one day when the ship was pitching having stumbled into the cabin with a wooden <unk> of <unk> he <unk> the officers so that they didnt get over it in a week upon which he was dismissed and returned to the forecastle now nobody is so heartily <unk> as a <unk> lazy <unk> <unk> a sailor has no bowels of <unk> for him yet useless as such a character may be in many respects a ships company is by no means disposed to let him reap any benefit from his <unk> regarded in the light of a mechanical power whenever there is any plain hard work to be done he is put to it like a <unk> <unk> giving him a pry then again he is set about all the <unk> work is there a heavy job at <unk> to be done he is pitched neck and shoulders into a <unk> and set to work at it moreover he is made to fetch and carry like a dog like as not if the mate sends him after his quadrant on the way he is met by the captain who orders him to pick some oakum and while he is hunting up a bit of rope a sailor comes along and wants to know what the <unk> hes after and bids him be off to the forecastle obey the last order is a <unk> <unk> at sea so the <unk> afraid to refuse to do anything rushes about distracted and does nothing in the end receiving a shower of <unk> and <unk> from all quarters added to his other hardships he is seldom permitted to open his mouth unless spoken to and then he might better keep silent alas for him if he should happen to be anything of a <unk> for in an evil hour should he <unk> a joke he would never know the last of it the <unk> of others however upon himself must be received in the greatest <unk> woe be unto him if at <unk> he so much as look sideways at the <unk> before the rest are helped then he is obliged to <unk> guilty to every piece of mischief which the real <unk> refuses to <unk> thus taking the place of that <unk> rascal nobody ashore in short there is no end to his tribulations the <unk> spirits often sink and the first result of his being moody and miserable is naturally enough an utter neglect of his toilet the sailors perhaps ought to make allowances but heartless as they are they do not no sooner is his <unk> questioned than they rise upon him like a mob of the middle ages upon a jew drag him into the <unk> and strip him to the <unk> in vain he <unk> for mercy in vain calls upon the captain to save him alas i say again for the <unk> at sea he is the <unk> wretch the watery world over and such was <unk> <unk> of all <unk> the most <unk> and most miserable a forlorn <unk> <unk> mortal he was too one of those whom you know at a glance to have been tried hard and long in the furnace of <unk> his face was an absolute puzzle though sharp and sallow it had neither the wrinkles of age nor the <unk> of youth so that for the soul of me i could hardly tell whether he was twentyfive or fifty but to his history in his better days it seems he had been a <unk> <unk> in london somewhere about <unk> and on <unk> wore a hue coat and metal buttons and spent his <unk> in a <unk> smoking his pipe and drinking his ale like a free and easy <unk> <unk> that he was but this did not last long for an <unk> old fool was the ruin of him he was told that london might do very well for elderly gentlemen and invalids but for a lad of spirit <unk> was the land of promise in a dark day <unk> wound up his affairs and embarked arriving in <unk> with a small capital and after a while <unk> snug and comfortable by <unk> of hard <unk> he took unto himself a wife and so far as she was concerned might then have gone into the country and retired for she effectually did his business in short the lady worked him woe in heart and pocket and in the end ran off with his till and his <unk> <unk> went to the sign of the pipe and <unk> got <unk> and over his fifth <unk> <unk> <unk> intention carried out for the next day he shipped as landsman aboard the <unk> south seaman the <unk> would have fared far better had it not been for his heart which was soft and <unk> a kind word made a fool of him and hence most of the <unk> he got into two or three <unk> aware of his <unk> used to draw him out in conversation whenever the most <unk> and <unk> old seamen were present to give an instance the watch below just waked from their sleep are all at breakfast and <unk> in one corner is <unk> partaking of its <unk> now sailors newly waked are no <unk> and therefore not a word is spoken everybody <unk> his biscuit grim and <unk> at this juncture an <unk> <unk> <unk> the forecastle tin can in hand and seats himself beside the <unk> hard fare this <unk> he begins hard enough too for them thats known better and lived in <unk> i say now <unk> <unk> you were back to <unk> this morning what would you have for breakfast eh have for breakfast cried <unk> in a rapture dont speak of it what <unk> that fellow here growled an old <unk> turning round <unk> oh nothing nothing said jack and then leaning over to rope yarn he bade him go on but speak lower well then said he in a smuggled tone his eyes lighting up like two lanterns well then id go to mother <unk> that makes the great <unk> id go there you know and cock my foot on the <unk> and call for a <unk> o <unk> to begin with what then <unk> why then <unk> continued the poor victim unconsciously <unk> with his theme why then id draw my chair up and call for <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to customers <unk> my dear says i you looks <unk> this <unk> give me a nice <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> my love and i wants a <unk> of hale and three nice hot <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> i wants a <unk> and be <unk> to you roared black dan with an oath whereupon dragged over the chests the <unk> fellow is <unk> on deck i always made a point of <unk> poor <unk> when i could and for this reason was a great favourite of his chapter xv chips and <unk> bound into port chips and <unk> increased their devotion to the bottle and to the unspeakable <unk> of the rest these jolly <unk> the <unk> as the men called <unk> about deck day after day in the <unk> mood imaginable but jolly as they were in the main two more discreet <unk> it would be hard to find no one ever saw them take anything except when the regular allowance was served out by the steward and to make them quite sober and sensible you had only to ask them how they contrived to keep otherwise some time after however their secret <unk> out the casks of <unk> were kept down the <unk> which for this reason was secured with bar and <unk> the cooper nevertheless from time to time effected a <unk> entry by descending into the <unk> and then at the risk of being jammed to death crawling along over a thousand <unk> to where the casks were stowed on the first expedition the only one to be got at lay among others upon its <unk> with the <unk> well over with a bit of iron <unk> <unk> bent and a good deal of prying and <unk> the <unk> was forced in and then the coopers <unk> attached to the end of the <unk> was drawn in and <unk> absorbed liquor being deliberately <unk> into a small bucket <unk> was a man after a <unk> own heart drinking steadily until just <unk> <unk> he contrived to continue so getting neither more nor less <unk> but to use his own phrase remaining just about right when in this interesting state he had a free <unk> in his gait a queer way of <unk> up his <unk> looked <unk> steady at you when speaking and for the rest was in very tolerable spirits at these times moreover he was exceedingly patriotic and in a most amusing way frequently showed his patriotism whenever he happened to encounter <unk> a goodnatured <unk> <unk> aboard it must be known here by the <unk> that the cooper had a true sailor admiration for lord nelson but he entertained a very <unk> idea of the personal appearance of the hero not content with <unk> him of an eye and an arm he stoutly maintained that he had also lost a leg in one of his battles under this impression he sometimes <unk> up to <unk> with one leg curiously locked behind him into his right arm at the same time closing an eye in this attitude he would call upon him to look up and behold the man who gave his countrymen such a <unk> at <unk> look you <unk> says he staggering about and <unk> hard with one eye to keep the other shut look you one <unk> me half a <unk> one leg one arm one <unk> me with only a piece of a <unk> flogged your whole shabby nation do you deny it you <unk> the <unk> was a <unk> of a man and understanding but little english seldom made anything of a reply so the cooper generally dropped his leg and marched off with the air of a man who <unk> saying anything further chapter xvi we encounter a gale the mild blue weather we enjoyed after leaving the marquesas gradually changed as we ran farther south and approached tahiti in these generally tranquil seas the wind sometimes blows with great violence though as every sailor knows a spicy gale in the tropic latitudes of the pacific is far different from a tempest in the howling north atlantic we soon found ourselves <unk> with the waves while the before mild trades like a woman roused blew fiercely but still warmly in our face for all this the mate carried sail without <unk> and as for brave little <unk> she stood up to it well and though once in a while <unk> in the trough of a sea sprang to her keel again and showed play every old timber <unk> spar <unk> <unk> cord strained and yet spite of all she plunged on her way like a <unk> <unk> <unk> that he was sometimes stood in the <unk> with the spray every now and then dashing over him and shouting out well done <unk> into it <unk> hurrah one afternoon there was a mighty queer noise aloft which set the men running in every direction it was the <unk> crash it broke off just above the cap and held there by the rigging dashed with every roll from side to side with all the <unk> that belonged to it the yard hung by a hair and at every pitch <unk> against the <unk> while the sail streamed in ribbons and the loose ropes coiled and <unk> the air like <unk> stand from under and down came the rattling blocks like so many shot the yard with a snap and a plunge went hissing into the sea disappeared and shot its full length out again the crest of a great wave then broke over <unk> ship rushed <unk> we saw the stick no more while this lively breeze continued <unk> our old black cook was in great <unk> like most south seamen the <unk> <unk> or <unk> was planted on the larboard side of the forecastle under such a press of canvas and with the heavy sea running the <unk> diving her bows under now and then shipped green glassy waves which breaking over the <unk> fairly <unk> that part of the ship and washed clean aft the <unk> to be fairly lashed down to its <unk> as a sort of <unk> to the <unk> about these times <unk> always wore what he called his gale suit among other things comprising a <unk> and a huge pair of <unk> <unk> reaching almost to his knees thus <unk> for a ducking or a drowning as the case might be our <unk> <unk> drew to the slides of his temple and performed his sooty rites in secret so afraid was the old man of being washed overboard that he actually fastened one end of a small line to his <unk> and coiling the rest about him made use of it as occasion required when engaged outside he <unk> the cord and secured one end to a <unk> in the deck so that if a chance sea washed him off his feet it could do nothing more one evening just as he was getting supper the <unk> <unk> up on her stern like a vicious colt and when she settled again forward fairly <unk> a tremendous sea nothing could withstand it one side of the rotten <unk> came in with a crash it smote the <unk> tore it from its <unk> and after <unk> it about dashed it against the windlass where it stranded the water then poured along the deck like a flood rolling over and over pots pans and <unk> and even old <unk> himself who went <unk> along like a porpoise striking the taffrail the wave subsided and washing from side to side left the drowning cook high and dry on the <unk> his extinguished pipe still between his teeth and almost <unk> in two the few men on deck having sprung into the <unk> <unk> did nothing but roar at his calamity the same night our <unk> snapped off like a <unk> and our <unk> came down by the run by the following morning the wind in a great measure had gone down the sea with it and by noon we had repaired our <unk> as well as we could and were sailing along as pleasantly as ever but there was no help for the <unk> bulwarks we had nothing to replace them and so whenever it <unk> again our <unk> craft went along with her splintered prow dripping but kicking up her fleet heels just as high as before chapter xvii the coral islands how far we sailed to the westward after leaving the marquesas or what might have been our latitude and longitude at any particular time or how many leagues we voyaged on our passage to tahiti are matters about which i am sorry to say i cannot with any accuracy enlighten the reader <unk> as navigator kept our reckoning and as hinted before kept it all to himself at noon he brought out his quadrant a rusty old thing so <unk> that it might have belonged to an <unk> sometimes when rather <unk> from his <unk> he went staggering about deck instrument to eye looking all over for the <unk> phenomenon which any sober observer might have seen right overhead how upon earth he contrived on some occasions to settle his latitude is more than i can tell the longitude he must either have obtained by the rule of three or else by special revelation not that the <unk> in the cabin was seldom to be relied on or was any ways <unk> quite the contrary it stood <unk> and by that means no doubt the true <unk> <unk> the period of stopping at <unk> preserved to a second the mate however in addition to his dead reckoning pretended to ascertain his meridian distance from bow bells by an occasional <unk> observation this i believe consists in <unk> with the proper instruments the <unk> distance between the moon and some one of the stars the operation generally requires two observers to take sights and at one and the same time now though the mate alone might have been thought well calculated for this inasmuch as he generally saw things double the doctor was usually called upon to play a sort of second quadrant to <unk> first and what with the <unk> of both they used to furnish a good deal of diversion the mates tremulous attempts to level his instrument at the star he was after were comical enough for my own part when he did catch sight of it i hardly knew how he managed to separate it from the <unk> host revolving in his own brain however by hook or by <unk> he <unk> us along and before many days a fellow sent aloft to <unk> a rent in the <unk> threw his hat into the air and <unk> out land ho land it was but in what part of the south seas <unk> alone knew and some doubted whether even he did but no sooner was the announcement made than he came running on deck spyglass in hand and clapping it to his eye turned round with the air of a man receiving <unk> assurance of something he was quite certain of before the land was precisely that for which he had been steering and with a wind in less than twentyfour hours we would sight tahiti what he said was <unk> the island turned out to be one of the <unk> or low <unk> called the coral <unk> the most remarkable and interesting in the pacific lying to the east of tahiti the nearest are within a days sail of that place they are very numerous mostly small low and level sometimes wooded but always covered with verdure many are <unk> others resemble a <unk> in figure these last are nothing more than narrow circles of land surrounding a smooth lagoon connected by a single opening with the sea some of the <unk> said to have subterranean <unk> have no visible ones the <unk> island in such cases being a complete zone of <unk> other <unk> still are girdled by numbers of small green islets very near to each other the origin of the entire group is generally ascribed to the coral insect according to some naturalists this wonderful little creature <unk> its <unk> at the bottom of the sea after the lapse of centuries carries them up to the surface where its labours cease here the <unk> of the coral <unk> all floating bodies forming after a time a soil in which the seeds carried thither by birds <unk> and cover the whole with <unk> here and there all over this archipelago numberless naked detached coral <unk> are seen just emerging as it were from the ocean these would appear to be islands in the very process of <unk> any rate one involuntarily <unk> so on beholding them as far as i know there are but few breadfruit trees in any part of the <unk> group in many places the cocoanut even does not grow though in others it largely <unk> consequently some of the islands are altogether uninhabited others support but a single family and in no place is the population very large in some respects the natives resemble the <unk> their language too is very similar the people of the <unk> <unk> whom however but little is <unk> a bad name as cannibals and for that reason their hospitality is seldom <unk> by the mariner within a few years past missionaries from the society group have settled among the leeward islands where the natives have treated them kindly indeed nominally many of these people are now christians and through the political influence of their <unk> no doubt a short time since came <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the queen of tahiti with which island they always carried on considerable intercourse the coral islands are principally visited by the <unk> fishermen who arrive in small <unk> carrying not more than five or six men for a long while the business was <unk> by <unk> the french <unk> at tahiti but a <unk> by birth who in one year is said to have sent to france fifty thousand dollars worth of shells the oysters are found in the <unk> and about the reefs and for <unk> nails a day or a <unk> still less the natives are hired to dive after them a great deal of cocoanut oil is also obtained in various places some of the uninhabited islands are covered with dense groves and the <unk> nuts which have fallen year after year lie upon the ground in incredible quantities two or three men provided with the necessary <unk> for trying out the oil will in the course of a week or two obtain enough to load one of the large <unk> cocoanut oil is now <unk> in different parts of the south seas and forms no small part of the <unk> carried on with <unk> vessels a considerable quantity is annually <unk> from the society islands to <unk> it is used in lamps and for <unk> being much <unk> than the sperm and for both purposes better than the <unk> oil they bottle it up in large bamboos six or eight feet long and these form part of the <unk> <unk> of tahiti to return to the ship the wind dying away evening came on before we drew near the island but we had it in view during the whole afternoon it was small and round presenting one <unk> level free from trees and did not seem four feet above the water beyond it was another and larger island about which a tropical sunset was throwing its glories <unk> all that part of the heavens and making it flame like a vast dyed <unk> illuminated the trades scarce filled our <unk> sails the air was languid with the <unk> of a thousand strange <unk> <unk> upon inhaling it one of the sick who had recently shown symptoms of scurvy cried out in pain and was carried below this is no unusual effect in such instances on we glided within less than a cables length of the shore which was <unk> with foam that sparkled all round within <unk> the still blue lagoon no living thing was seen and for aught we knew we might have been the first mortals who had ever beheld the spot the thought was <unk> to the fancy nor could i help dreaming of the endless <unk> and galleries far below the reach of the mariners lead and what strange shapes were lurking there think of those arch creatures the mermaids chasing each other in and out of the coral cells and catching their long hair in the coral twigs chapter xviii tahiti at early dawn of the following morning we saw the peaks of tahiti in clear weather they may be seen at the distance of ninety miles <unk> shouted <unk> <unk> and running out upon the bowsprit when the land was first faintly descried in the distance but when the clouds floated away and showed the three peaks standing like <unk> against the sky and the bold shore undulating along the horizon the tears <unk> from his eyes poor fellow it was not <unk> green <unk> was many a long league off tahiti is by far the most famous island in the south seas indeed a variety of causes has made it almost <unk> its natural features alone <unk> it from the surrounding groups two round and lofty <unk> whose mountains rise nine thousand feet above the level of the ocean are connected by a low narrow <unk> the whole being some one hundred miles in circuit from the great central peaks of the larger <unk> <unk> and <unk> land <unk> on all sides to the sea in sloping green ridges between these are broad and shadowy <unk> aspect each a <unk> with fine streams and thickly wooded unlike many of the other islands there <unk> nearly all round tahiti a belt of low <unk> soil <unk> with the <unk> <unk> here chiefly the natives dwell seen from the sea the prospect is magnificent it is one mass of shaded <unk> of green from beach to mountain top <unk> <unk> with valleys ridges glens and <unk> over the ridges here and there the loftier peaks fling their shadows and far down the valleys at the head of these the <unk> flash out into the sunlight as if pouring through vertical bowers of verdure such enchantment too breathes over the whole that it seems a fairy world all fresh and <unk> from the hand of the creator upon a near approach the picture loses not its <unk> it is no <unk> to say that to a european of any <unk> who for the first time <unk> back into these <unk> from the haunts of the <unk> ineffable repose and beauty of the landscape is such that every object strikes him like something seen in a dream and for a time he almost refuses to believe that scenes like these should have a <unk> existence no wonder that the french bestowed upon the island the appellation of the new <unk> often says de <unk> i thought i was walking in the garden of <unk> nor when first discovered did the inhabitants of this charming country at all diminish the wonder and admiration of the voyager their physical beauty and amiable <unk> <unk> completely with the <unk> of their clime in truth everything about them was calculated to awaken the liveliest interest glance at their civil and religious institutions to their king divine rights were paid while for poetry their <unk> <unk> that of ancient <unk> of tahiti earlier and more full accounts were given than of any other island in polynesia and this is the reason why it still <unk> so strong a hold on the sympathies of all readers of south sea voyages the <unk> of its first visitors containing as they did such romantic descriptions of a country and people before unheard of produced a marked sensation throughout europe and when the first <unk> were carried thither <unk> in london and <unk> in paris were <unk> by <unk> <unk> and ladies in addition to all this several <unk> <unk> more or less connected with tahiti have tended to increase its <unk> over two centuries ago <unk> the spaniard is supposed to have touched at the island and at intervals <unk> byron cook de <unk> <unk> le <unk> and other illustrious <unk> <unk> their vessels in its <unk> here the famous <unk> of <unk> was observed in <unk> here the memorable mutiny of the bounty afterwards had its origin it was to the pagans of tahiti that the first regularly <unk> <unk> missionaries were sent and from their shores also have sailed successive <unk> to the neighbouring islands these with other events which might be mentioned have united in keeping up the first interest which the place awakened and the recent proceedings of the french have more than ever called forth the sympathies of the public chapter xix a <unk> about <unk> the sight of the island was right welcome going into harbour after a cruise is always joyous enough and the sailor is apt to indulge in all sorts of pleasant <unk> but to us the occasion was heightened by many things peculiar to our situation since steering for the land our prospects had been much talked over by many it was supposed that should the captain leave the ship the crew were no longer bound by her articles this was the opinion of our forecastle <unk> though probably it would not have been <unk> by the marine courts of law at any rate such was the state of both vessel and crew that whatever might be the event a long stay and many <unk> in tahiti were <unk> predicted everybody was in high spirits the sick who had been improving day by day since the change in our destination were on deck and leaning over the bulwarks some all animation and others silently admiring an object <unk> for its stately <unk> from the sea the quarterdeck however furnished a marked contrast to what was going on at the other end of the ship the <unk> was there as usual <unk> by himself and <unk> walked to and fro in deep thought every now and then looking to windward or darting into the cabin and quickly returning with all our light sails <unk> spread we held on our way until with the doctors glass <unk> the village metropolis of tahiti came into view several ships were descried lying in the harbour and among them one which loomed up black and large her two rows of teeth <unk> a frigate this was the <unk> <unk> last from the marquesas and carrying at the fore the flag of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> hardly had we made her out when the <unk> of her guns came over the water she was firing a salute which afterwards turned out to be in honour of a <unk> or <unk> far as the natives were <unk> forced <unk> of tahiti to the french that morning concluded the <unk> had hardly died away when <unk> voice was heard giving an order so unexpected that <unk> started stand by to haul back the mainyard whats that mean shouted the men are we not going into port tumble after here and no words cried the mate and in a moment the mainyard swung round when with her <unk> pointing out to sea the <unk> lay as quiet as a duck we all looked <unk> was to come next presently the steward made his appearance carrying a <unk> which he spread out in the <unk> of the captains boat two or three chests and other things belonging to his master were similarly disposed of this was enough a slight hint <unk> for a sailor still adhering to his resolution to keep the ship at sea in spite of everything the captain doubtless intended to set himself ashore leaving the vessel under the mate to resume her voyage at once but after a certain period agreed upon to touch at the island and take him off all this of course could easily be done without approaching any nearer the land with the <unk> than we now were invalid whaling captains often adopt a plan like this but in the present instance it was wholly <unk> and everything considered at war with the <unk> principles of prudence and humanity and although on <unk> part this resolution showed more <unk> than he had ever been given credit for it at the same time <unk> an unaccountable simplicity in supposing that such a crew would in any way submit to the <unk> it was soon made plain that we were right in our suspicions and the men became furious the cooper and carpenter volunteered to head a mutiny forthwith and while <unk> was below four or five rushed aft to <unk> down the cabin scuttle others throwing down the <unk> called out to the rest to <unk> a hand and fill away for the land all this was done in an instant and things were looking critical when doctor long ghost and myself prevailed upon them to wait a while and do nothing hastily there was plenty of time and the ship was completely in our power while the preparations were still going on in the cabin we mustered the men together and went into counsel upon the forecastle it was with much difficulty that we could bring these rash spirits to a calm consideration of the case but the doctors influence at last began to tell and with a few exceptions they agreed to be guided by him assured that if they did so the ship would eventually be brought to her anchors without <unk> getting into trouble still they told us up and down that if peaceable means failed they would seize little <unk> and carry her into <unk> if they all swung for it but for the present the captain should have his own way by this time everything was ready the boat was lowered and brought to the gangway and the captain was helped on deck by the mate and steward it was the first time we had seen him in more than two weeks and he was greatly altered as if anxious to elude every eye a <unk> <unk> hat was pulled down over his brow so that his face was only visible when the brim flapped aside by a sling rigged from the mainyard the cook and <unk> now assisted in lowering him into the boat as he went moaning over the side he must have heard the whispered maledictions of his crew while the steward was busy adjusting matters in the boat the mate after a private interview with the <unk> turned round abruptly and told us that he was going ashore with the captain to return as soon as possible in his absence <unk> as next in rank would command there being nothing to do but keep the ship at a safe distance from the land he then sprang into the boat and with only the cook and steward as oarsmen steered for the shore <unk> thus leaving the ship in the mens hands contrary to the mates advice was another evidence of his simplicity for at this particular juncture had neither the doctor nor myself been aboard there is no telling what they might have done for the nonce <unk> was captain and so far as mere seamanship was concerned he was as competent to command as <unk> in truth a better seaman never swore this <unk> by the <unk> together with a surprising familiarity with most nautical names and phrases comprised about all the english he knew being a <unk> and as such having <unk> to the cabin this man though not yet civilized was according to sea usages which know no exceptions held superior to the sailors and therefore nothing was said against his being left in charge of the ship nor did it occasion any surprise some additional account must be given of <unk> in the first place he was far from being liked a dark moody savage everybody but the mate more or less <unk> or feared him nor were these feelings <unk> unless duty called he seldom went among the crew hard stories too were told about him something in particular concerning an hereditary <unk> to kill men and eat them true he came from a race of cannibals but that was all that was known to a certainty whatever unpleasant ideas were connected with the <unk> his personal appearance no way <unk> them unlike most of his countrymen he was if anything below the ordinary height but then he was all <unk> and under his <unk> tattooed skin the muscles worked like steel rods hair crisp and <unk> curled over shaggy brows and <unk> small intense eyes always on the glare in short he was none of your <unk> barbarians previous to this he had been two or three voyages in <unk> whalemen always however as in the present instance shipping at the bay of islands and receiving his discharge there on the homewardbound passage in this way his countrymen frequently enter on board the <unk> whaling vessels there was a man among us who had sailed with the <unk> on his first voyage and he told me that he had not changed a <unk> since then some queer things this fellow told me the following is one of his stories i give it for what it is worth <unk> however that from what i know of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> sometimes performed in the <unk> fishery i believe in its substantial truth as may be believed <unk> was a wild one after a fish indeed all new <unk> engaged in this business are it seems to <unk> <unk> with their bloodthirsty propensities at sea the best english they speak is the south seamans <unk> in lowering away a dead whale or a stove boat game to the <unk> these fellows are generally selected for <unk> a post in which a nervous timid man would be rather out of his element in darting the <unk> of course stands erect in the head of the boat one knee braced against a support but <unk> <unk> this and was always pulled up to his fish <unk> himself right on the gunwale but to my story one morning at daybreak they brought him up to a large long whale he darted his harpoon and missed and the fish sounded after a while the monster rose again about a mile off and they made after him but he was frightened or <unk> as they call it and noon came and the boat was still chasing him in whaling as long as the fish is in sight and no matter what may have been previously undergone there is no giving up except when night comes and nowadays when whales are so hard to be got frequently not even then at last <unk> whale was alongside for the second time he darted both harpoons but as sometimes happens to the best men by some unaccountable chance once more missed though it is well known that such <unk> will happen at times they nevertheless occasion the <unk> disappointment to a boats crew generally expressed in curses both loud and deep and no wonder let any man pull with might and main for hours and hours together under a burning sun and if it do not make him a little <unk> he is no sailor the <unk> of the seamen may have maddened the <unk> however it was no sooner was he brought up again than harpoon in hand he bounded upon the whales back and for one <unk> second was seen there the next all was foam and fury and both were out of sight the men <unk> off flinging overboard the line as fast as they could while ahead nothing was seen but a red whirlpool of blood and brine presently a dark object swam out the line began to <unk> then smoked round the <unk> and quick as thought the boat sped like an arrow through the water they were fast and the whale was running where was the <unk> his brown hand was on the boats gunwale and he was hauled aboard in the very midst of the mad bubbles that burst under the bows such a man or devil if you will was <unk> chapter xx the round <unk> from shore after the captain left the <unk> died away and as is usual about these islands toward noon it fell a dead calm there was nothing to do but haul up the courses run down the <unk> and lay and roll upon the swells the repose of the elements seemed to communicate itself to the men and for a time there was a lull early in the afternoon the mate having left the captain at <unk> returned to the ship according to the steward they were to go ashore again right after dinner with the remainder of <unk> effects on gaining the deck <unk> purposely avoided us and went below without saying a word meanwhile long ghost and i <unk> hard to <unk> the right spirit among the crew <unk> upon them that a little patience and management would in the end accomplish all that their violence could and that too without making a serious matter of it for my own part i felt that i was under a foreign flag that an english <unk> was close at hand and that sailors seldom obtain justice it was best to be prudent still so much did i <unk> with the men so far at least as their real <unk> were concerned and so convinced was i of the cruelty and <unk> of what captain <unk> seemed bent upon that if need were i stood ready to raise a hand in spite of all we could do some of them again became most <unk> breathing nothing but downright mutiny when we went below to dinner these fellows stirred up such a prodigious tumult that the old hull fairly echoed many and fierce too were the <unk> delivered and uproarious the <unk> of the sailors among others long <unk> <unk> the doctor afterwards called <unk> <unk> rose in his place and addressed the forecastle parliament in the following strain look ye <unk> if after whats happened this here craft goes to sea with us we are no men and thats the way to say it speak the word my <unk> and ill pilot her in ive been to tahiti before and i can do it whereupon he sat down amid a universal <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of tin pans the few invalids who as yet had not been <unk> engaged with the rest now taking part in the applause creaking their <unk> and swinging their hammocks cries also were heard of handspikes and a <unk> out stunsails hurrah several now ran on deck and for the moment i thought it was all over with us but we finally succeeded in <unk> some degree of quiet at last by way of diverting their thoughts i proposed that a round <unk> should be prepared and sent ashore to the <unk> by <unk> the cook the idea took <unk> and i was told to set about it at once on turning to the doctor for the requisite materials he told me he had none there was not a <unk> even in any of his books so after great search a damp musty volume entitled a history of the most <unk> and bloody <unk> was produced and its two remaining blank leaves being torn out were by help of a little pitch lengthened into one sheet for ink some of the soot over the lamp was then mixed with water by a fellow of a literary turn and an immense <unk> plucked from a distended albatross wing which nailed against the bowsprit <unk> had long formed an <unk> of the forecastle supplied a pen making use of the <unk> thus provided i <unk> upon a <unk> a <unk> statement of our <unk> concluding with the earnest hope that the <unk> would at once come off and see how matters stood for himself eight beneath the note was described the circle about which the names were to be written the great object of a round <unk> being to arrange the <unk> in such a way that although they are all found in a ring no man can be picked out as the leader of it few among them had any regular names many answering to some familiar title expressive of a personal trait or oftener still to the name of the place from which they hailed and in one or two cases were known by a handy syllable or two significant of nothing in particular but the men who bore them some to be sure had for the sake of <unk> shipped under a <unk> <unk> or pursers name these however were almost forgotten by themselves and so to give the document an air of <unk> it was decided that every mans name should be put down as it went among the crew it is due to the doctor to say that the <unk> device was his folded and sealed with a drop of tar the round <unk> was directed to the english <unk> tahiti and handed to the cook was by him delivered into that gentlemans hands as soon as the mate went ashore on the return of the boat <unk> after dark we learned a good deal from old <unk> who having been allowed to run about as much as he pleased had spent his time <unk> owing to the proceedings of the french everything in tahiti was in an uproar <unk> the missionary <unk> was absent in england but his place was temporarily filled by one <unk> an <unk> white man born on the island and the son of an old missionary of that name still living with natives and foreigners alike <unk> the younger was exceedingly <unk> being held an unprincipled and <unk> man a character <unk> by his subsequent conduct <unk> selecting a man like this to attend to the duties of his office had occasioned general <unk> ashore though never in europe or america the acting <unk> had been several voyages to <unk> in a schooner belonging to the mission and therefore our surprise was <unk> when <unk> told us that he and captain <unk> were as sociable as could <unk> acquaintances in fact and that the latter had taken up his quarters at <unk> house for us this <unk> ill the mate was now assailed by a hundred questions as to what was going to be done with us his only reply was that in the morning the <unk> would pay us a visit and settle everything after holding our ground off the harbour during the night in the morning a shore boat manned by natives was seen coming off in it were <unk> and another white man who proved to be a doctor johnson an englishman and a <unk> physician of <unk> stopping our headway as they approached <unk> advanced to the gangway to receive them no sooner did the <unk> touch the deck than he gave us a specimen of what he was mr <unk> he cried <unk> and not <unk> to notice the respectful salutation of the person addressed mr <unk> tack ship and stand off from the land upon this the men looked hard at him anxious to see what sort of a looking <unk> he was upon inspection he turned out to be an exceedingly minute <unk> with a <unk> <unk> nose and a <unk> thin pair of legs there was nothing else <unk> about him <unk> with <unk> <unk> at once obeyed the order and the ships head soon pointed out to sea now contempt is as frequently produced at first sight as love and thus was it with respect to <unk> no one could look at him without <unk> a strong <unk> or a cordial desire to entertain such a feeling the first <unk> opportunity there was such an intolerable air of conceit about this man that it was almost as much as one could do to refrain from running up and <unk> him so the <unk> is come exclaimed navy <unk> who like all the rest invariably styled him thus much to mine and the doctors diversion ay said another and for no good ill be bound such were some of the observations made as <unk> and the mate went below conversing but no one exceeded the cooper in the violence with which he <unk> against the ship and everything connected with her swearing like a <unk> he called the mainmast to witness that if he <unk> ever again went out of sight of land in the <unk> he prayed heaven that a fate might be <unk> too remarkable to be here related much had he to say also concerning the <unk> of what we had to <unk> fit for a dog besides <unk> upon the <unk> of <unk> the vessel longer to a man of the mates <unk> habits with so many sick too what could we expect to do in the fishery it was no use talking come what come might the ship must let go her anchor now as <unk> besides being an able seaman a cod in the forecastle and about the oldest man in it was moreover thus deeply <unk> with feelings so warmly responded to by the rest he was all at once selected to <unk> as <unk> as soon as the <unk> should see fit to address us the <unk> was made contrary to mine and the doctors advice however all assured us they would keep quiet and hear everything <unk> had to say before doing anything <unk> we were not kept long in suspense for very soon he was seen standing in the cabin gangway with the <unk> tin case containing the ships papers and <unk> at once sung out for the ships company to muster on the quarterdeck chapter xxi proceedings of the <unk> the order was instantly obeyed and the sailors ranged themselves facing the <unk> they were a wild company men of many <unk> at all precise in their toilet arrangements but picturesque in their very tatters my friend the long doctor was there too and with a view perhaps of <unk> the sympathies of the <unk> for a gentleman in distress had taken more than ordinary pains with his appearance but among the sailors he looked like a <unk> blown off to sea and <unk> with <unk> the forlorn rope yarn however was by far the most remarkable figure <unk> that he was his <unk> of <unk> had long since been <unk> and he was now fain to go about in whatever he could pick up his upper <unk> <unk> article of dress which he persisted in wearing though torn from his back twenty times in the <unk> an old <unk> jacket or <unk> coat formerly belonging to captain <unk> and which had formed one of his <unk> when steward by the side of <unk> was the mate bareheaded his gray locks lying in rings upon his <unk> brow and his keen eye <unk> the crowd as if he knew their every thought his frock hung loosely <unk> his round throat mossy chest and short and nervous arm <unk> with <unk> <unk> and quaint with many a device in india ink in the midst of a portentous silence the <unk> <unk> his papers evidently <unk> to produce an effect by the exceeding <unk> of his looks mr <unk> call off their names and he handed him a list of the ships company all answered but the <unk> and the two mariners at the bottom of the sea it was now supposed that the round <unk> would be produced and something said about it but not so among the <unk> papers that <unk> document was thought to be perceived but if there it was too much <unk> to be made a subject of comment some present very justly regarding it as an uncommon literary <unk> had been <unk> all sorts of <unk> therefrom and were therefore much touched at this neglect well men began <unk> again after a short pause although you all look hearty enough im told there are some sick among you now then mr <unk> call off the names on that <unk> of yours and let them go over to the other side of the <unk> should like to see who they are so then said he after we had all passed over you are the sick fellows are you very good i shall have you seen to you will go down into the cabin one by one to doctor johnson who will report your respective cases to me such as he pronounces in a dying state i shall have sent ashore the rest will be provided with everything <unk> and remain aboard at this announcement we gazed strangely at each other anxious to see who it was that looked like dying and pretty nearly <unk> to stay aboard and get well rather than go ashore and be buried there were some nevertheless who saw very plainly what <unk> was at and they acted accordingly for my own part i resolved to assume as dying an expression as possible hoping that on the strength of it i might be sent ashore and so get rid of the ship without any further trouble with this intention i determined to take no part in anything that might happen until my case was decided upon as for the doctor he had all along pretended to be more or less <unk> and by a significant look now given me it was plain that he was becoming <unk> worse the invalids disposed of for the present and one of them having gone below to be examined the <unk> turned round to the rest and addressed them as follows men im going to ask you two or three <unk> one of you answer yes or no and the rest keep silent now then have you anything to say against your mate mr <unk> and he looked sharply among the sailors and at last right into the eye of the cooper whom everybody was eyeing well sir <unk> <unk> we cant say anything against mr <unk> seamanship but i want no <unk> cried the <unk> breaking in answer me yes or <unk> you anything to say against mr <unk> i was going on to say sir mr <unk> a very good man but then here the mate looked <unk> at <unk> and <unk> after <unk> out something looked straight down to a <unk> in the deck and stopped short a rather assuming fellow <unk> the cooper had sported many feathers in his cap he was now showing the white one so much then for that part of the business exclaimed <unk> <unk> you have nothing to say against him i see upon this several seemed to be on the point of saying a good deal but disconcerted by the coopers conduct checked themselves and the <unk> proceeded have you enough to eat aboard answer me you man who spoke before well i dont know as to that said the cooper looking <unk> uneasy and trying to edge back but pushed forward again some of that salt horse aint as sweet as it might be thats not what i asked you shouted the <unk> growing brave quite fast answer my questions as i put them or ill find a way to make you this was going a little too far the <unk> into which the coopers <unk> had thrown the sailors now <unk> no <unk> and one of <unk> young american who went by the name of <unk> out from among the rest and fetching the cooper a blow that sent him humming over toward the <unk> flourished a naked <unk> in the air and burst forth with im the little fellow that can answer your questions just put them to me once <unk> but the <unk> had no more questions to ask just then for at the alarming apparition of <unk> knife and the extraordinary effect produced upon <unk> he had <unk> his head down the <unk> and was holding it there upon the mates assuring him however that it was all over he looked up quite <unk> if not frightened but evidently determined to put as fierce a face on the matter as practicable speaking sharply he warned all present to look out and then repeated the question whether there was enough to eat aboard <unk> now turned <unk> and he was assailed by a perfect hurricane of yells in which the oaths fell like <unk> <unk> this what dye mean he cried upon the first lull who told you all to speak at once here you man with the knife youll be putting <unk> eyes out yet dye hear you sir you seem to have a good deal to say who are you pray where did you ship im nothing more nor a bloody <unk> retorted <unk> stepping forward <unk> and eyeing him and if you want to know i shipped at the islands about four months ago only four months ago and here you have more to say than men who have been aboard the whole voyage and the <unk> made a dash at looking furious but failed let me hear no more from you sir wheres that respectable <unk> man the cooper hes the one to answer my questions theres no <unk> <unk> men aboard returned <unk> were all a parcel of mutineers and pirates all this time the mate was holding his peace and <unk> now completely abashed and at a loss what to do took him by the arm and walked across the deck returning to the <unk> after a close conversation he abruptly addressed the sailors without taking any further notice of what had just happened for reasons you all know men this ship has been placed in my hands as captain <unk> will remain ashore for the present your mate mr <unk> will command until his <unk> according to my judgment there is no reason why the voyage should not be at once resumed especially as i shall see that you have two more <unk> and enough good men to man three boats as for the sick neither you nor i have anything to do with them they will be attended to by doctor johnson but ive explained that matter before as soon as things can be <unk> a day or two at <unk> will go to sea for a three months cruise touching here at the end of it for your captain let me hear a good report of you now when you come back at present you will continue lying off and on the harbour i will send you fresh provisions as soon as i can get them there ive nothing more to say go forward to your stations and without another word he wheeled round to descend into the cabin but hardly had he concluded before the incensed men were dancing about him on every side and calling upon him to <unk> an ear each one for himself denied the <unk> of what he proposed to do insisted upon the necessity for taking the ship in and finally gave him to understand <unk> and roundly that go to sea in her they would not in the midst of this <unk> uproar the alarmed <unk> stood fast by the scuttle his <unk> had been decided upon beforehand indeed they must have been <unk> ashore between him and the captain for all he said as he now hurried below was go forward men im through with you you should have mentioned these matters before my arrangements are concluded go forward i say ive nothing more to say to you and drawing over the slide of the scuttle he disappeared upon the very point of following him down the attention of the exasperated seamen was called off to a party who had just then taken the <unk> <unk> in hand amid a shower of <unk> and <unk> the traitor was borne along to the forecastle <unk> forbear to relate what followed chapter xxii the <unk> departure during the scenes just described doctor johnson was engaged in examining the sick of whom as it turned out all but two were to remain in the ship he had evidently received his <unk> from <unk> one of the last called below into the cabin just as the quarterdeck gathering dispersed i came on deck quite incensed my <unk> which to tell the truth was now much better was put down as in a great measure affected and my name was on the list of those who would be fit for any duty in a day or two this was enough as for doctor long ghost the shore physician instead of extending to him any professional sympathy had treated him very <unk> to a certain extent therefore we were now both bent on making common cause with the sailors i must explain myself here all we wanted was to have the ship snugly anchored in <unk> bay entertaining no doubt that could this be done it would in some way or other <unk> lead to our <unk> without a downright mutiny there was but one way to accomplish this to induce the men to refuse all further duty unless it were to work the vessel in the only difficulty lay in <unk> them within proper bounds nor was it without certain misgivings that i found myself so situated that i must necessarily link myself however <unk> with such a desperate company and in an enterprise too of which it was hard to conjecture what might be the result but anything like <unk> was out of the question and unconditional submission was equally so on going forward we found them ten times more tumultuous than ever after again <unk> some degree of tranquillity we once more urged our plan of quietly <unk> duty and awaiting the result at first few would hear of it but in the end a good number were convinced by our <unk> others held out nor were those who thought with us in all things to be <unk> upon <unk> coming on deck to enter his boat he was beset on all sides and for a moment i thought the ship would be seized before his very eyes nothing more to say to you men my arrangements are made go forward where you belong ill take no insolence and in a <unk> <unk> hurried over the side in the midst of a volley of <unk> shortly after his departure the mate ordered the cook and steward into his boat and saying that he was going to see how the captain did left us as before under the charge of <unk> at this time we were lying becalmed pretty close in with the land having gone about again our maintopsail <unk> against the mast with every roll the departure of the <unk> and <unk> was followed by a scene absolutely <unk> the sailors ran about deck like <unk> <unk> all the while leaning against the taffrail by himself smoking his heathenish stone pipe and never <unk> the cooper who that morning had got himself into a fluid of an exceedingly high <unk> now did his best to <unk> the favour of the crew without distinction of party he called upon all hands to step up and partake of the contents of his bucket but it was quite plain that before offering to <unk> others he had taken the wise precaution of getting well <unk> himself he was now once more happy in the affection of his shipmates who one and all pronounced him sound to the <unk> the <unk> soon told and with great difficulty we restrained a party in the very act of breaking into the <unk> in pursuit of more all manner of <unk> were now played masthead there what dye see <unk> beauty hailing the <unk> through an enormous copper <unk> stand by for stays roared flash jack <unk> off with the cooks axe at the fastening of the <unk> <unk> out for <unk> shrieked the portuguese <unk> darting a <unk> through the cabin skylight and heave round <unk> men sung out navy <unk> dancing a <unk> on the forecastle chapter xxiii the second night off <unk> toward sunset the mate came off singing merrily in the stern of his boat and in <unk> to climb up the side succeeded in going plump into the water he was rescued by the steward and carried across the deck with many moving <unk> of love for his <unk> tumbled into the <unk> he soon fell asleep and waking about midnight somewhat <unk> went forward among the men here to prepare for what follows we must leave him for a moment it was now plain enough that <unk> was by no means unwilling to take the <unk> to sea indeed there was nothing he so much desired though what his reasons were seeing our situation we could only conjecture nevertheless so it was and having counted much upon his rough <unk> with the men to <unk> them to a short cruise under him he had consequently been disappointed in their behaviour still thinking that they would take a different view of the matter when they came to know what fine times he had in store for them he resolved upon trying a little persuasion so on going forward he put his head down the forecastle scuttle and hailed us quite cordially inviting us down into the cabin where he said he had something to make merry withal nothing loth we went and throwing ourselves along the transom waited for the steward to serve us as the can <unk> <unk> leaning on the table and occupying the captains <unk> secured to the deck opened his mind as <unk> and freely as ever he was by no means yet sober he told us we were acting very <unk> that if we only stuck to the ship he would lead us all a jovial life of it <unk> the casks still remaining <unk> in the <unk> wooden cellar it was even hinted vaguely that such a thing might happen as our not coming back for the captain whom he spoke of but lightly <unk> what he had often said before that he was no sailor moreover and perhaps with special reference to doctor long ghost and myself he assured us generally that if there were any among us <unk> inclined he would take great pleasure in <unk> such the whole art and mystery of navigation including the <unk> use of his quadrant i should have mentioned that previous to this he had taken the doctor aside and said something about <unk> him in the cabin with augmented dignity beside throwing out a hint that i myself was in some way or other to be promoted but it was all to no purpose bent the men were upon going ashore and there was no moving them at last he flew into a <unk> increased by the <unk> of his <unk> with many <unk> concluded by driving everybody out of the cabin we tumbled up the gangway in high <unk> upon deck everything looked so quiet that some of the most <unk> spirits actually lamented that there was so little prospect of an <unk> <unk> before morning it was not five minutes however ere these fellows were <unk> <unk> <unk> to be a runaway <unk> and for reasons of his own one of the few who still remained on <unk> for the sake of the fun gone down with the rest into the cabin where <unk> who meanwhile was left in charge of the deck had frequently called out for him at first <unk> pretended not to hear but on being sung out for again and again <unk> refused at the same time casting some <unk> reflections on the <unk> maternal origin which the latter had been long enough among the sailors to understand as in the highest degree <unk> so just after the men came up from below <unk> <unk> him out and gave him such a cursing in his broken <unk> that it was enough to frighten one the <unk> was the worse for liquor indeed the <unk> had been <unk> also and before we knew it a blow was struck by <unk> and the two men came together like <unk> the <unk> was a practised <unk> but the savage knew nothing of the art <unk> and so they were even it was clear <unk> and <unk> till both came to the deck here they rolled over and over in the middle of a ring which seemed to form of itself at last the white mans head fell back and his face grew purple <unk> teeth were at his throat rushing in all round they hauled the savage off but not until repeatedly struck on the head would he let go his rage was now absolutely demoniac he lay glaring and writhing on the deck without <unk> to rise <unk> as they supposed he was from his attitude the men rejoiced at seeing him thus <unk> left him after <unk> him in sailor style for a cannibal and a coward <unk> was attended to and led below soon after this the rest also with but few exceptions retired into the forecastle and having been up nearly all the previous night they quickly dropped about the chests and rolled into the hammocks in an hours time not a sound could be heard in that part of the ship before <unk> was dragged away the mate had in vain endeavoured to separate the <unk> repeatedly striking the <unk> but the seamen <unk> at last kept him off and intoxicated as he was when they dispersed he knew enough to charge the <unk> steady seaman be it <unk> the present safety of the ship and then went below when he fell directly into another <unk> sleep having remained upon deck with the doctor some time after the rest had gone below i was just on the point of following him down when i saw the <unk> rise draw a bucket of water and holding it high above his head pour its contents right over him this he repeated several times there was nothing very peculiar in the act but something else about him struck me however i thought no more of it but descended the scuttle after a restless nap i found the atmosphere of the forecastle so close from nearly all the men being down at the same time that i hunted up an old <unk> and went on deck <unk> to sleep it out there till morning here i found the cook and steward <unk> hope yarn and the <unk> who being all quiet <unk> fellows and holding aloof from the rest since the captains departure had been ordered by the mate not to go below until sunrise they were lying under the lee of the bulwarks two or three fast asleep and the others smoking their pipes and conversing to my surprise <unk> was at the helm but there being so few to stand there now they told me he had offered to take his turn with the rest at the same time heading the watch and to this of course they made no objection it was a fine bright night all moon and stars and white crests of waves the breeze was light but <unk> and <unk> poor little <unk> as if nothing had happened was heading in for the land which rose high and hazy in the distance after the days uproar the tranquillity of the scene was soothing and i leaned over the side to enjoy it more than ever did i now lament my <unk> it was useless to <unk> and i could not <unk> myself so at last becoming drowsy i made a bed with my jacket under the windlass and tried to forget myself how long i lay there i cannot tell but as i rose the first object that met my eye was <unk> at the helm his dark figure slowly rising and falling with the ships motion against the <unk> heavens behind he seemed all impatience and expectation standing at arms length from the <unk> with one foot advanced and his bare head thrust forward where i was the watch were out of sight and no one else was stirring the deserted decks and broad white sails were gleaming in the moonlight presently a swelling dashing sound came upon my ear and i had a sort of vague consciousness that i had been hearing it before the next instant i was broad awake and on my feet eight ahead and so near that my heart stood still was a long line of breakers heaving and <unk> it was the coral reef <unk> the island behind it and almost casting their shadows upon the deck were the sleeping mountains about whose hazy peaks the gray dawn was just breaking the breeze had <unk> and with a steady gliding motion we were running straight for the reef all was taken in at a glance the fell purpose of <unk> was obvious and with a frenzied shout to wake the watch i rushed aft they sprang to their feet bewildered and after a short but desperate <unk> we tore him from the helm in <unk> with him the <unk> for a moment <unk> to leeward thus fortunately bringing the ships head to the wind and so <unk> her progress previous to this she had been kept three or four points free so as to close with the breakers her headway now <unk> i <unk> the helm keeping the sails just lifting while we glided obliquely toward the land to have run off before the <unk> easy <unk> have been almost instant destruction owing to a <unk> of the reef in that direction at this time the <unk> and the steward were still struggling with the furious <unk> and the others were running about <unk> and shouting but darting forward the instant i had the helm the old cook thundered on the forecastle with a <unk> breakers breakers close <unk> ship bout ship up came the sailors staring about them in stupid horror haul back the <unk> let go the lee <unk> <unk> about about were now shouted on all sides while distracted by a thousand orders they ran hither and thither fairly <unk> it seemed all over with us and i was just upon the point of throwing the ship full into the wind a step which saving us for the instant would have sealed our fate in the end when a sharp cry shot by my ear like the flight of an arrow it was <unk> all ready <unk> hard down round and round went the <unk> <unk> with her short keel spinning to windward like a top soon the <unk> lashed the stays and the men more selfpossessed flew to the braces mainsail haul was now heard as the fresh breeze streamed fore and aft the deck and directly the <unk> were whirled round in a <unk> more we were sailing away from the land on the other tack with every sail distended turning on her heel within little more than a biscuits toss of the reef no earthly power could have saved us were it not that up to the very brink of the coral <unk> there are no soundings chapter xxiv <unk> of the crew the purpose of <unk> had been made known to the men generally by the watch and now that our salvation was certain by an instinctive impulse they raised a cry and rushed toward him just before liberated by <unk> and the steward he was standing <unk> by the <unk> and as the <unk> sailors came on his <unk> eye rolled and his <unk> <unk> over his head down with him strike him down hang him at the mainyard such were the shouts now raised but he stood <unk> and for a single instant they absolutely <unk> cowards cried <unk> and he flung himself upon him the steel descended like a ray of light but did no harm for the sailors heart was beating against the <unk> before he was aware they both fell to the deck when the knife was instantly seized and <unk> secured <unk> <unk> with him was again the cry give him a <unk> overboard with him and he was dragged along the deck struggling and fighting with tooth and nail all this uproar immediately over the mates head at last roused him from his <unk> nap and he came staggering on deck whats this he shouted running right in among them its the <unk> <unk> they are going to murder him <unk> here <unk> poor rope yarn crawling close up to him avast avast roared <unk> making a spring toward <unk> and dashing two or three of the sailors aside at this moment the wretch was partly flung over the bulwarks which shook with his frantic struggles in vain the doctor and others tried to save him the men listened to nothing murder and mutiny by the salt sea shouted the mate and dashing his arms right and left he planted his iron hand upon the <unk> shoulder there are two of us now and as you serve him you serve me he cried turning fiercely round over with them together then exclaimed the carpenter springing forward but the rest fell back before the <unk> front of <unk> and with the speed of thought <unk> unharmed stood upon deck aft with ye cried his <unk> and he pushed him right among the men taking care to follow him up close giving the sailors no time to recover he pushed the <unk> before him till they came to the cabin scuttle when he drew the slide over him and stood still throughout <unk> never spoke one word now <unk> where ye belong cried the mate addressing the seamen who by this time rallying again had no idea of losing their victim the <unk> the <unk> they shouted here the doctor in answer to the mates repeated questions stepped forward and related what <unk> had been doing a matter which the mate but dimly understood from the violent <unk> he had been hearing for a moment he seemed to <unk> but at last turning the key of the <unk> of the slide he breathed through his set <unk> cant have him ill hand him over to the <unk> so <unk> with ye i say when theres any drowning to be done ill pass the word so away with ye ye bloodthirsty pirates it was to no purpose that they begged or threatened <unk> although by no means sober stood his ground <unk> and before long they dispersed soon to forget everything that had happened though we had no opportunity to hear him confess it <unk> intention to destroy us was beyond all question his only motive could have been a desire to revenge the <unk> heaped upon him the night previous operating upon a heart <unk> savage and at no time <unk> disposed toward the crew during the whole of this scene the doctor did his best to save him but well knowing that all i could do would have been equally useless i maintained my place at the wheel indeed no one but <unk> could have prevented this murder chapter xxv <unk> <unk> an old shipmate during the morning of the day which dawned upon the events just recounted we remained a little to leeward of the harbour waiting the appearance of the <unk> who had promised the mate to come off in a shore boat for the purpose of seeing him by this time the men had forced his secret from the cooper and the consequence was that they kept him continually coming and going from the <unk> the mate must have known this but he said nothing notwithstanding all the dancing and singing and occasional fighting which announced the flow of the <unk> the peaceable influence which the doctor and myself had <unk> been <unk> was now very nearly at an end confident from the aspect of matters that the ship after all would be obliged to go in and learning moreover that the mate had said so the sailors for the present seemed in no hurry about it especially as the bucket of <unk> gave such generous cheer as for <unk> we were told that after putting him in double irons the mate had locked him up in the captains stateroom taking the additional precaution of keeping the cabin scuttle secured from this time forward we never saw the <unk> again a circumstance which will explain itself as the narrative proceeds noon came and no <unk> and as the afternoon advanced without any word even from the shore the mate was justly incensed more especially as he had taken great pains to keep perfectly sober against <unk> arrival two or three hours before <unk> a small schooner came out of the harbour and headed over for the adjoining island of <unk> or <unk> in plain sight about fifteen miles distant the wind failing the current swept her down under our bows where we had a fair glimpse of the natives on her decks there were a score of them perhaps lounging upon spread mats and smoking their pipes on floating so near and hearing the <unk> cries of our crew and beholding their <unk> they must have taken us for a pirate at any rate they got out their sweeps and pulled away as fast as they could the sight of our two <unk> which by way of a joke were now run out of the <unk> giving a fresh <unk> to their efforts but they had not gone far when a white man with a red <unk> about his waist made his appearance on deck the natives immediately <unk> hailing us loudly he said he was coming aboard and after some confusion on the <unk> decks a small canoe was launched <unk> and in a minute or two he was with us he turned out to be an old shipmate of <unk> one <unk> long supposed dead but now <unk> on the island the meeting of these men under the circumstances is one of a thousand <unk> appearing <unk> in fiction but nevertheless frequently <unk> in actual lives of adventure some fifteen years previous they had sailed together as officers of the <unk> <unk> of london a south seaman somewhere near the new <unk> they struck one night upon an unknown reef and in a few hours the <unk> went to pieces the boats however were saved some provisions also a quadrant and a few other articles but several of the men were lost before they got clear of the wreck the three boats commanded respectively by the captain <unk> and the third mate then set sail for a small english settlement at the bay of islands in new zealand of course they kept together as much as possible after being at sea about a week a <unk> in the captains boat went crazy and it being dangerous to keep him they tried to throw him overboard in the confusion that ensued the boat <unk> from the sails <unk> and a considerable sea running at the time and the other boats being separated more than usual only one man was picked up the very next night it blew a heavy gale and the remaining boats taking in all sail made bundles of their oars flung them overboard and rode to them with plenty of line when morning broke <unk> and his men were alone upon the ocean the third mates boat in all probability having gone down after great hardships the survivors caught sight of a brig which took them on board and eventually landed them at <unk> ever since then our mate had sailed from that port never once hearing of his lost shipmates whom by this time of course he had long given up judge then his feelings when <unk> the lost third mate the instant he touched the deck rushed up and <unk> him by the hand during the gale his line had parted so that the boat drifting fast to leeward was out of sight by morning reduced after this to great extremities the boat touched for fruit at an island of which they knew nothing the natives at first received them kindly but one of the men getting into a quarrel on account of a woman and the rest taking his part they were all <unk> but <unk> who at the time was in an adjoining village after staying on the island more than two years he finally escaped in the boat of an american whaler which landed him at valparaiso from this period he had continued to follow the seas as a man before the mast until about eighteen months previous when he went ashore at tahiti where he now owned the schooner we saw in which he <unk> among the neighbouring islands the breeze springing up again just after nightfall <unk> left us promising his old shipmate to see him again three days hence in <unk> harbour chapter xxvi we enter the <unk> the pilot exhausted by the days <unk> most of the men went below at an early hour leaving the deck to the steward and two of the men remaining on duty the mate with <unk> and the <unk> engaging to relieve them at midnight at that hour the <unk> standing off shore under short <unk> to be tacked it was not long after midnight when we were <unk> in the forecastle by the lion roar of <unk> voice ordering a pull at the <unk> and soon afterwards a <unk> struck the scuttle and all hands were called to take the ship into port this was wholly unexpected but we learned directly that the mate no longer <unk> upon the <unk> and renouncing all thought of <unk> the men to change their minds had suddenly made up his own he was going to beat up to the entrance of the harbour so as to show a signal for a pilot before sunrise notwithstanding this the sailors absolutely refused to assist in working the ship under any circumstances whatever to all mine and the doctors entreaties <unk> a deaf ear sink or strike they swore they would have nothing more to do with her this <unk> was to be attributed in a great measure to the effects of their late <unk> with a strong breeze all sail set and the ship in the hands of four or five men exhausted by two nights watching our situation was bad enough especially as the mate seemed more reckless than ever and we were now to tack ship several times close under the land well knowing that if anything untoward happened to the vessel before morning it would be imputed to the conduct of the crew and so lead to serious results should they ever be brought to trial i called together those on deck to witness my <unk> now that the <unk> was destined for the harbour the only object for which i at least had been struggling i was willing to do what i could toward carrying her in safely in this step i was followed by the doctor the hours passed anxiously until morning when being well to windward of the mouth of the harbour we bore up for it with the <unk> at the fore no sign however of boat or pilot was seen and after running close in several times the ensign was set at the <unk> union down in distress but it was of no avail <unk> to <unk> this unaccountable <unk> on the part of those ashore <unk> quite enraged now determined to stand boldly in upon his own <unk> trusting solely to what he remembered of the harbour on a visit there many years previous this resolution was characteristic even with a competent pilot <unk> bay is considered a <unk> one to enter formed by a bold sweep of the shore it is <unk> seaward by the coral reef upon which the <unk> break with great violence after stretching across the bay the barrier <unk> on toward point <unk> in the district of <unk> eight or nine miles distant here there is an opening by which ships enter and glide down the smooth deep canal between the reef and the shore to the harbour but by seamen generally the leeward entrance is preferred as the wind is extremely <unk> inside the reef this latter entrance is a break in the barrier directly facing the bay and village of <unk> it is very narrow and from the <unk> winds currents and sunken rocks ships now and then <unk> their keels against the coral but the mate was not to be <unk> so <unk> what men he had at the braces he sprang upon the bulwarks and bidding everybody keep wide awake ordered the helm up in a few moments we were running in being toward noon the wind was fast leaving us and by the time the breakers were roaring on either hand little more than <unk> was left but on we <unk> and <unk> <unk> the green <unk> objects here and there strewn in our path <unk> occasionally looking down in the water and then about him with the utmost <unk> and not a word spoken just fanned along thus it was not many minutes ere we were past all danger and floated into the placid basin within this was the <unk> specimen of his seamanship that he ever gave us as we held on toward the frigate and shipping a canoe coming out from among them approached in it were a boy and an old <unk> islanders the former nearly naked and the latter dressed in an old naval <unk> both were paddling with might and main the old man once in a while tearing his paddle out of the water and after rapping his companion over the head both fell to with fresh <unk> as they came within hail the old fellow springing to his feet and flourishing his paddle cut some of the <unk> <unk> all the while <unk> something which at first we could not understand presently we made out the <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> for you <unk> be fine for come no <unk> say you <unk> say you <unk> <unk> no <unk> <unk> no <unk> you d me you no pilot t all i d you you hear this <unk> which showed plainly that whatever the profane old rascal was at he was in right good earnest produced peals of laughter from the ship upon which he seemed to get beside himself and the boy who with suspended paddle was staring about him received a sound box over the head which set him to work in a twinkling and brought the canoe quite near the <unk> now opening afresh it turned out that his vehement <unk> was all addressed to the mate still standing <unk> on the bulwarks but <unk> was in no humour for nonsense so with a sailors blessing he ordered him off the old fellow then flew into a regular frenzy cursing and swearing worse than any civilized being i ever heard you <unk> me he shouted you know me ah well me <unk> me <unk> pilot now long time ay cried <unk> quite surprised as indeed we all were you are the pilot then you old pagan why didnt you come off before this ah me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you long time but no me <unk> <unk> youyou <unk> <unk> nuee <unk> bad paddle away with ye roared <unk> in a rage be off or ill dart a harpoon at ye but instead of obeying the order <unk> seizing his paddle darted the canoe right up to the gangway and in two bounds stood on deck pulling a <unk> silk handkerchief still lower over his brow and improving the sit of his <unk> with a vigorous jerk he then <unk> up to the mate and in a more flowery style than ever gave him to understand that the <unk> <unk> himself was before him that the ship was his until the anchor was down and he should like to hear what <unk> had to say to it as there now seemed little doubt that he was all he claimed to be the <unk> was at last <unk> our gentleman now proceeded to bring us to an anchor jumping up between the <unk> and <unk> out luff luff <unk> off <unk> off and <unk> upon each time being respectfully responded to by the man at the helm at this time our <unk> was almost gone and yet in giving his orders the passionate old man made as much <unk> as a white squall aboard the flying <unk> <unk> turned out to be the regular pilot of the harbour a post be it known of no small profit and in his eyes at least invested with immense importance our <unk> entrance therefore was regarded as highly insulting and tending to <unk> both the dignity and <unk> of his office the old man is something of a <unk> having an understanding with the elements certain <unk> of theirs are exhibited for his particular benefit unusually clear weather with a fine steady breeze is a certain sign that a merchantman is at hand <unk> seen from the harbour are tokens of a whaling vessels approach and thunder and lightning happening so seldom as they do are proof positive that a manofwar is drawing near in short <unk> the pilot is quite a character in his way and no one visits tahiti without hearing some curious story about him chapter xxvii a glance at <unk> are sent aboard the frigate the village of <unk> struck us all very pleasantly lying in a semicircle round the bay the tasteful <unk> of the chiefs and foreign <unk> impart an air of tropical <unk> heightened by the palmtrees waving here and there and the <unk> groves of the breadfruit in the background the <unk> <unk> of the common people are out of sight and there is nothing to <unk> the prospect all round the water <unk> a wide smooth beach of mixed pebbles and fragments of coral this forms the <unk> of the village the <unk> houses all facing <unk> <unk> of the tides being so inconsiderable that they cause no <unk> the <unk> <unk> fine large <unk> a site on one side of the bay a green <unk> slopes off to the sea and in front waves the english flag across the water the <unk> also and the stars and stripes <unk> the <unk> of the other <unk> what greatly added to the <unk> of the bay at this time was the condemned hull of a large ship which at the farther end of the harbour lay <unk> upon the beach its stern settled low in the water and the other end high and dry from where we lay the trees behind seemed to lock their leafy boughs over its bowsprit which from its position looked nearly upright she was an american whaler a very old craft having sprung a leak at sea she had made all sail for the island to heave down for <unk> found utterly <unk> however her oil was taken out and sent home in another vessel the hull was then stripped and sold for a <unk> before leaving tahiti i had the curiosity to go over this poor old ship thus stranded on a strange shore what were my emotions when i saw upon her stern the name of a small town on the river <unk> she was from the noble stream on whose banks i was born in whose waters i had a hundred times bathed in an instant palmtrees and <unk> and <unk> spires and <unk> mingled in one vision of the present and the past but we must not leave little <unk> at last the wishes of many were <unk> and like an <unk> <unk> her rusty little anchor was caught in the coral groves at the bottom of <unk> bay this must have been more than forty days after leaving the marquesas the sails were yet <unk> when a boat came alongside with our esteemed friend <unk> the <unk> <unk> this <unk> this mr <unk> he began looking very savage as he touched the deck what brings you in without orders you did not come off to us as you promised sir and there was no hanging on longer with nobody to work the ship was the <unk> reply so the infernal scoundrels held <unk> they very good ill make them sweat for it and he eyed the <unk> men with unwonted intrepidity the truth was he felt <unk> now than when outside the reef muster the mutineers on the quarterdeck he continued drive them aft sir sick and well i have a word to say to them now men said he you think its all well with you i suppose you wished the ship in and here she is captain <unk> ashore and you think you must go too but well see about <unk> miserably <unk> you these last were his very words mr <unk> call off the names of those who did not refuse duty and let them go over to the starboard side this done a list was made out of the mutineers as he was pleased to call the rest among these the doctor and myself were included though the former stepped forward and boldly <unk> the office held by him when the vessel left <unk> the mate <unk> had always been <unk> the service rendered by myself two nights previous as well as my conduct when he announced his intention to enter the harbour for myself i stoutly maintained that according to the <unk> of the agreement made with captain <unk> my time aboard the ship had <unk> cruise being <unk> at an end however it had been brought <unk> i claimed my discharge but <unk> would hear nothing marking something in my manner nevertheless he asked my name and country and then observed with a sneer ah you are the lad i see that wrote the round <unk> ill take good care of you my fine <unk> back sir as for poor long ghost he <unk> him as a <unk> <unk> though what under heaven he meant by that <unk> title is more than i can tell upon this the doctor gave him such a piece of his mind that the <unk> furiously commanded him to hold his peace or he would instantly have him seized into the rigging and flogged there was no help for either of <unk> were <unk> by the company we kept all were now sent forward not a word being said as to what he intended doing with us after a talk with the mate the <unk> withdrew going aboard the french frigate which lay within a cables length we now suspected his object and since matters had come to this pass were rejoiced at it in a day or two the frenchman was to sail for valparaiso the usual place of <unk> for the english squadron in the pacific and doubtless <unk> meant to put us on board and send us thither to be delivered up should our conjecture prove correct all we had to expect according to our most experienced shipmates was the <unk> end of a cruise in one of her majestys ships and a discharge before long at <unk> we now proceeded to put on all the clothes we <unk> over frock and <unk> over <unk> as to be in readiness for <unk> at a moments warning armed ships allow nothing superfluous to litter up the deck and therefore should we go aboard the frigate our chests and their contents would have to be left behind in an hours time the first cutter of the <unk> <unk> came alongside manned by eighteen or twenty sailors armed with cutlasses and boarding <unk> officers of course wearing their <unk> and the <unk> in an official cocked hat borrowed for the occasion the boat was painted a pirate black its crew were a dark <unk> set and the officers uncommonly <unk> little <unk> on the whole they were calculated to <unk> <unk> object doubtless in bringing them summoned aft again <unk> name was called separately and being solemnly reminded that it was his last chance to escape punishment was asked if he still refused duty the response was <unk> ay sir i do in some cases followed up by divers <unk> observations cut short by <unk> ordering the <unk> to the cutter as a general thing the order was promptly <unk> taking a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> by way of showing not only their <unk> activity of body but their alacrity in <unk> with all reasonable <unk> having <unk> their resolution not to pull another rope of the <unk> if at once restored to perfect <unk> the invalids with the exception of the two to be set ashore accompanied us into the cutter they were in high spirits so much so that something was <unk> about their not having been quite as ill as pretended the coopers name was the last called we did not hear what he answered but he stayed behind nothing was done about the <unk> <unk> clear from the ship three loud cheers were raised flash jack and others receiving a sharp reprimand for it from the <unk> goodbye little <unk> cried navy <unk> as we swept under the bows dont fall overboard <unk> said another to the poor <unk> who with <unk> the <unk> and others left behind was looking over at us from the forecastle give her three more cried <unk> springing to his feet and whirling his hat round you <unk> dam <unk> shouted the lieutenant of the party bringing the flat of his <unk> across his shoulders you now <unk> steel the doctor and myself more discreet sat quietly in the bow of the cutter and for my own part though i did not <unk> what i had done my reflections were far from being <unk> chapter <unk> reception from the frenchman in a few moments we were <unk> in the frigates gangway the first <unk> elderly <unk> officer in an <unk> coat and <unk> gold <unk> up and <unk> upon us this gentlemans head was a mere bald spot his legs sticks in short his whole physical <unk> seemed exhausted in the <unk> of one enormous <unk> old <unk> as he was forthwith <unk> now received a paper from the <unk> and opening it proceeded to compare the goods delivered with the <unk> after being thoroughly counted a meek little midshipman was called and we were soon after given in custody to <unk> <unk> with <unk> and muskets preceded by a <unk> functionary whom we took for one of the ships corporals from his <unk> and the gold lace on his <unk> we were now escorted down the ladders to the berthdeck here we were politely <unk> all round the man with the bamboo <unk> the utmost solicitude in giving us a good fit from a large basket of the articles of <unk> <unk> taken by surprise at such an <unk> reception a few of the party <unk> but all <unk> was at last overcome and finally our feet were inserted into heavy <unk> of iron running along a great bar bolted down to the deck after this we considered ourselves permanently established in our new quarters the <unk> take their old iron exclaimed the doctor if id known this id stayed behind ha ha cried flash jack youre in for it doctor long ghost my hands and feet are any way was the reply they placed a sentry over us a great <unk> of a fellow who marched up and down with a dilapidated old cutlass of most extraordinary dimensions from its length we had some idea that it was expressly intended to keep a crowd in <unk> over the heads of <unk> say so as to get a cut at somebody behind mercy <unk> the doctor with a shudder what a sensation it must be to be killed by such a <unk> we <unk> till night when one of the boys came along with a couple of <unk> containing a thin <unk> fluid with oily particles floating on top the young wag told us this was <unk> it turned out to be nothing more than <unk> warm water such as it was nevertheless we were fain to make a meal of it our sentry being <unk> enough to <unk> our <unk> the <unk> passed from mouth to mouth and were soon emptied the next morning when the <unk> back was turned <unk> whom we took for an english sailor tossed over a few <unk> the <unk> of which we afterward used for cups on the second day nothing happened worthy of record on the third we were <unk> by the following scene a man whom we supposed a boatswains mate from the silver whistle hanging from his neck came below driving before him a couple of <unk> boys and followed by a whole troop of <unk> in tears the pair it seemed were sent down to be <unk> by command of an officer the rest had accompanied them out of sympathy the boatswains mate went to work without delay seizing the poor little culprits by their loose frocks and using a <unk> without mercy the other boys <unk> clasped their hands and fell on their knees but in vain the boatswains mate only hit out at them once in a while making them yell ten times louder than ever in the midst of the tumult down comes a midshipman who with a great air orders the man on deck and running in among the bows sets them to <unk> in all directions the whole of this proceeding was regarded with infinite scorn by navy <unk> who years before had been captain of the foretop on board a lineofbattle ship in his estimation it was a <unk> piece of business throughout they did things <unk> in the english navy chapter <unk> the <unk> <unk> i cannot forbear a brief reflection upon the scene ending the last chapter the <unk> of the young culprits although significant of the <unk> discipline of a french manofwar may also be considered as in some measure characteristic of the nation in an american or english ship a boy when flogged is either lashed to the <unk> of a gun or brought right up to the gratings the same way the men are but as a general rule he is never <unk> beyond his strength you seldom or never draw a cry from the young rogue he <unk> his tongue and stands up to it like a hero if practicable which is not always the case he makes a point of smiling under the operation and so far from his companions taking any <unk> on him they always make merry over his misfortunes should he turn baby and cry they are pretty sure to give him afterward a sly <unk> in some dark corner this tough training produces its legitimate results the boy becomes in time a <unk> tar equally ready to strip and take a dozen on board his own ship or cutlass in hand dash <unk> on board the enemys whereas the young frenchman as all the world knows makes but an indifferent seaman and though for the most part he fights well enough somehow or other he seldom fights well enough to beat how few <unk> have the french ever won but more how few ships have they ever carried by the <unk> true <unk> of naval courage but not a word against french <unk> is plenty of it but not of the right sort a yankees or an <unk> is the downright <unk> game the french fight better on land and not being essentially a maritime people they ought to stay there the best of <unk> they are no sailors and this carries me back to the <unk> <unk> as noble a specimen of what wood and iron can make as ever floated she was a new ship the present her maiden cruise the greatest pains having been taken in her construction she was accounted the crack craft in the french navy she is one of the heavy <unk> frigates now in <unk> all over the world and which we yankees were the first to introduce in action these are the most murderous vessels ever launched the model of the <unk> <unk> has all that warlike <unk> only to be seen in a fine fighting ship still there is a good deal of french <unk> about <unk> plates and other <unk> stuck on all over like <unk> on a handsome woman among other things she carries a stern gallery resting on the uplifted hands of two <unk> larger than life you step out upon this from the commodores cabin to behold the rich <unk> and <unk> and mahogany within one is almost prepared to see a <unk> of ladies trip forth on the <unk> for an <unk> but come to tread the gundeck and all thoughts like these are put to flight such batteries of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> or two thrown in as <unk> on the spardeck also are <unk> of enormous <unk> recently built this vessel of course had the benefit of the <unk> <unk> i was quite amazed to see on what high principles of art some exceedingly simple things were done but your <unk> is scientific about everything what other people accomplish by a few hard <unk> he delights in <unk> by a <unk> arrangement of the <unk> <unk> and screw what <unk> in a french air in exchanging naval <unk> i have known a french band play yankee <unk> with such a string of <unk> that no one but a pretty <unk> yankee could tell what they were at in the french navy they have no marines their men taking turns at carrying the musket are sailors one moment and soldiers the next a fellow running aloft in his line frock today tomorrow stands sentry at the admirals cabin door this is fatal to anything like proper sailor pride to make a man a seaman he should be put to no other duty indeed a thorough tar is <unk> for anything else and what is more this fact is the best evidence of his being a true sailor on board the <unk> <unk> they did not have enough to eat and what they did have was not of the right sort instead of letting the sailors file their teeth against the rim of a hard <unk> they baked their bread daily in <unk> little rolls then they had no grog as a substitute they <unk> the poor fellows with a thin sour <unk> juice of a few grapes perhaps to a <unk> of the juice of <unk> moreover the sailors asked for meat and they gave them <unk> a <unk> substitute as they well knew ever since leaving home they had been on short allowance at the present time those belonging to the <unk> thus getting an occasional opportunity to run <unk> sold their <unk> of bread to some less fortunate shipmate for <unk> its real value another thing tending to <unk> <unk> among the crew was their having such a devil of a fellow for a captain he was one of those horrid naval <unk> great <unk> in port he kept them constantly <unk> yards and sails and <unk> with the boats and at sea they were forever at quarters running in and out the enormous guns as if their arms were made for nothing else then there was the admiral aboard also and no doubt he too had a paternal eye over them in the ordinary <unk> of duty we could not but be struck with the <unk> <unk> behaviour of these men there was nothing of the national <unk> in their movements nothing of the quick precision perceptible on the deck of a <unk> armed vessel all this however when we came to know the reason was no matter of surprise <unk> of them were pressed men some old merchant sailors had been seized the very day they landed from distant voyages while the landsmen of whom there were many had been driven down from the country in herds and so sent to sea at the time i was quite amazed to hear of <unk> in a day of comparative peace but the <unk> is accounted for by the fact that of late the french have been building up a great military marine to take the place of that which nelson gave to the waves of the sea at trafalgar but it is to be hoped that they are not building their ships for the people across the channel to take in case of a war what a fluttering of french <unk> there would be though i say the french are no sailors i am far from seeking to <unk> them as a people they are an ingenious and right gallant nation and as an american i take pride in <unk> it chapter <unk> they take us <unk> happened there five days and nights if i remember right we were aboard the frigate on the afternoon of the fifth we were told that the next morning she sailed for valparaiso rejoiced at this we prayed for a speedy passage but as it turned out the <unk> had no idea of letting us off so easily to our no small surprise an officer came along toward night and ordered us out of irons being then mustered in the gangway we were escorted into a cutter alongside and pulled ashore accosted by <unk> as we struck the beach he delivered us up to a numerous guard of natives who at once conducted us to a house near by here we were made to sit down under a shade without and the <unk> and two elderly european <unk> passed by us and entered after some delay during which we were much diverted by the hilarious goodnature of our <unk> of our number was called out for followed by an order for him to enter the house alone on returning a moment after he told us we had little to encounter it had simply been asked whether he still continued of the same mind on <unk> yes something was put down upon a piece of paper and he was waved outside all being summoned in rotation my own turn came at last within <unk> and his two friends were seated <unk> at a <unk> <unk> a pen and a sheet of paper <unk> quite a businesslike air to the apartment these three gentlemen being arrayed in coats and pantaloons looked respectable at least in a country where complete <unk> of garments are so seldom met with one present essayed a solemn aspect but having a short neck and full face only made out to look stupid it was this individual who <unk> to take a paternal interest in myself after declaring my resolution with respect to the ship unalterable i was proceeding to withdraw in compliance with a sign from the <unk> when the stranger turned round to him saying wait a minute if you please mr <unk> let me talk to that youth come here my young friend im extremely sorry to see you <unk> with these bad men do you know what it will end in oh thats the lad that wrote the round <unk> interposed the <unk> he and that <unk> doctor are at the bottom of the whole <unk> outside sir i retired as from the presence of royalty backing out with many bows the evident prejudice of <unk> against both the doctor and myself was by no means inexplicable a man of any education before the mast is always looked upon with <unk> by his captain and never mind how peaceable he may be should any <unk> arise from his intellectual superiority he is deemed to exert an <unk> influence against the officers little as i had seen of captain <unk> the few glances cast upon me after being on board a week or so were sufficient to reveal his <unk> feeling <unk> by my <unk> companionship with long ghost whom he both feared and cordially hated <unk> relations with the <unk> readily <unk> the latters hostility the examination over <unk> and his friends advanced to the <unk> when the former assuming a severe expression pronounced our <unk> <unk> in the extreme nor was there any hope left our last chance for pardon was gone even were we to become <unk> and <unk> permission to return to duty it would not now be permitted oh get along with your <unk> <unk> exclaimed black dan absolutely indignant that his understanding should be thus insulted quite enraged <unk> bade him hold his peace and then summoning a fat old native to his side addressed him in <unk> giving directions for leading us away to a place of safe keeping hereupon being <unk> in order with the old man at our head we were put in motion with loud shouts along a fine <unk> running far on through wide groves of the cocoanut and breadfruit the rest of our escort <unk> on beside us in high <unk> <unk> broken english and in a hundred ways giving us to understand that <unk> was no favourite of theirs and that we were prime good fellows for holding out as we did they seemed to know our whole history the scenery around was delightful the tropical day was fast drawing to a close and from where we were the sun looked like a vast red fire burning in the <unk> rays falling <unk> through the endless ranks of trees and every leaf <unk> with flame escaped from the confined decks of the frigate the air breathed spices to us streams were heard flowing green boughs were rocking and far inland all sunset flushed rose the still steep peaks of the island as we proceeded i was more and more struck by the <unk> of the wide shaded road in several places <unk> bridges of wood were thrown over large <unk> others were spanned by a single arch of stone in any part of the road three <unk> might have <unk> abreast this beautiful <unk> far the best thing which civilization has done for the <unk> called by foreigners the <unk> road though for what reason i do not know originally <unk> for the convenience of the missionaries journeying from one station to another it almost completely <unk> the larger <unk> <unk> for a distance of at least sixty miles along the low <unk> lands <unk> the sea but on the side next <unk> or the lesser <unk> it sweeps through a narrow secluded valley and thus crosses the island in that direction the uninhabited interior being almost impenetrable from the <unk> glens frightful <unk> and sharp mountain ridges absolutely inaccessible is but little known even to the natives themselves and so instead of striking directly across from one village to another they follow the <unk> road round and round it is by no means however altogether <unk> on foot horses being now quite <unk> they were introduced from chili and possessing all the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the spanish breed are <unk> adapted to the tastes of the higher classes who as <unk> have become very expert the missionaries and chiefs never think of journeying except in the saddle and at all hours of the day you see the latter <unk> along at full speed like the sandwich islanders they ride like <unk> for miles and miles i have <unk> the <unk> road and never wearied of the continual change of scenery but wherever it leads <unk> through level woods across grassy glens or over hills waving with <unk> bright blue sea on one side and the green mountain <unk> on the other are always in sight chapter <unk> the <unk> <unk> about a mile from the village we came to a halt it was a beautiful spot a mountain stream here flowed at the foot of a verdant slope on one hand it murmured along until the waters spreading themselves upon a beach of small sparkling shells <unk> into the sea on the other was a long defile where the eye pursued a gleaming <unk> thread lost in shade and verdure the ground next the road was walled in by a low rude <unk> of stones and upon the summit of the slope beyond was a large native house the thatch dazzling white and in shape an oval <unk> <unk> <unk> the english jail cried our <unk> pointing to the building for a few months past having been used by the <unk> as a house of confinement for his <unk> sailors it was thus styled to <unk> it from similar places in and about <unk> though extremely romantic in appearance on a near approach it proved hut ill adapted to domestic comfort in short it was a mere shell recently built and still <unk> it was open all round and tufts of grass were growing here and there under the very roof the only piece of furniture was the stocks a clumsy machine for keeping people in one place which i believe is pretty much out of <unk> in most countries it is still in use however among the spaniards in south america from whom it seems the <unk> have borrowed the contrivance as well as the name by which all places of confinement are known among them the stocks were nothing more than two stout timbers about twenty feet in length and precisely alike one was placed <unk> on the ground and the other resting on top left at regular intervals along the <unk> several round holes the object of which was evident at a glance by this time our guide had informed us that he went by the name of <unk> <unk> captain <unk> and a hearty old <unk> he proved it was just the name for him from the first so pleased were we with the old man that we cheerfully acquiesced in his authority entering the building he set us about fetching heaps of dry leaves to spread behind the stocks for a couch a trunk of a small cocoanut tree was then placed for a <unk> a hard one but the natives are used to it for a pillow they use a little <unk> of wood scooped out and standing on four short <unk> sort of <unk> these arrangements completed captain <unk> proceeded to <unk> or secure us for the night the upper timber of the machine being lifted at one end and our <unk> placed in the semicircular spaces of the lower one the other beam was then dropped both being finally secured together by an old iron <unk> at either extremity this <unk> was performed to the boisterous mirth of the natives and diverted ourselves not a little captain <unk> now <unk> about like an old woman seeing the children to bed a basket of baked <unk> or indian <unk> was brought in and we were given a piece all round then a great counterpane of coarse brown tappa was stretched over the whole party and after sundry <unk> to <unk> and be <unk> other words to go to sleep and be good <unk> were left to ourselves fairly put to bed and tucked in much talk was now had concerning our prospects in life but the doctor and i who lay side by side thinking the occasion better adapted to meditation kept pretty silent and before long the rest ceased conversing and wearied with loss of rest on board the frigate were soon sound asleep after sliding from one reverie into another i started and gave the doctor a pinch he was dreaming however and resolved to follow his example i troubled him no more how the rest managed i know not but for my own part i found it very hard to get to sleep the consciousness of having ones foot <unk> and the <unk> of getting it anywhere else than just where it was was most <unk> but this was not all there was no way of lying but straight on your back unless to be sure ones limb went round and round in the <unk> like a <unk> upon getting into a sort of doze it was no wonder this uneasy posture gave me the <unk> under the <unk> that i was about some <unk> or other i gave my unfortunate member such a <unk> that i started up with the idea that <unk> was dragging the stocks away captain <unk> and his friends lived in a little <unk> hard by and when morning showed in the east the old gentleman came forth from that direction likewise emerging from a grove and <unk> us loudly as he approached finding everybody awake he set us at liberty and leading us down to the stream ordered every man to strip and <unk> all <unk> my boy <unk> wash he cried <unk> was a <unk> and had been to sea in his day as he many a time afterwards told us at this moment we were all alone with him and it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have given him the slip but he seemed to have no idea of such a thing treating us so frankly and cordially indeed that even had we thought of running we should have been ashamed of <unk> it he very well knew nevertheless as we ourselves were not slow in finding out that for various reasons any attempt of the kind without some previously arranged plan for leaving the island would be certain to fail as <unk> was a rare one every way i must give some account of him there was a good deal of personal appearance about him in short he was a <unk> giant over six feet in height and literally as big round as a <unk> the enormous bulk of some of the <unk> has been frequently spoken of by voyagers beside being the english <unk> <unk> as it were he carried on a little <unk> <unk> that is to say he owned several groves of the breadfruit and palm and never <unk> their growing close by was a <unk> patch of his which he occasionally visited <unk> seldom disposed of the produce of his lands it was all needed for domestic consumption indeed for <unk> i would have <unk> him against any three <unk> men at a <unk> feast a friend of <unk> told me that owing to his <unk> his visits to other parts of the island were much dreaded for according to <unk> customs hospitality without charge is enjoined upon <unk> and though it is reciprocal in most cases in <unk> it was almost out of the question the <unk> done to a native larder in one of his morning calls was more than could be made good by his <unk> spending the <unk> with them the old man as i have hinted had once upon a time been a cruise or two in a <unk> and therefore he <unk> himself upon his english having <unk> what he knew of it in the forecastle he talked little else than sailor phrases which sounded <unk> enough i asked him one day how old he was <unk> he exclaimed looking very profound in consequence of thoroughly understanding so <unk> a <unk> very <unk> <unk> man when <unk> <unk> captain cook <unk> in sight in sea <unk> came into view this was a thing impossible but <unk> my discourse to the man i <unk> you see <unk> <unk> how you like him oh he <unk> good friend of me and know my wife on my assuring him strongly that he could not have been born at the time he explained himself by saying that he was speaking of his father all the while this indeed might very well have been it is a curious fact that all these people young and old will tell you that they have enjoyed the honour of a personal acquaintance with the great navigator and if you listen to them they will go on and tell <unk> without end this springs from nothing but their great desire to please well knowing that a more agreeable topic for a white man could not be selected as for the <unk> of the thing they seem to have no idea of it days and years are all the same to them after our sunrise bath <unk> once more placed us in the stocks almost moved to tears at <unk> us to so great a hardship but he could not treat us otherwise he said on pain of the <unk> displeasure how long we were to be confined he did not know nor what was to be done with us in the end as noon advanced and no signs of a meal were visible <unk> inquired whether we were to be boarded as well as lodged at the <unk> de <unk> vast <unk> avast heaving or wait a <unk> <unk> food come ship by by and sure enough along comes rope <unk> with a wooden bucket of the <unk> villainous biscuit with a grin he said it was a present from <unk> it was all we were to get that day a great cry was now raised and well was it for the <unk> that lie had a pair of legs and the men could not use theirs one and all we resolved not to touch the bread come what come might and so we told the natives being <unk> fond of <unk> harder the <unk> were quite <unk> and offered to give us every day a small quantity of baked breadfruit and indian <unk> in exchange for the bread this we agreed to and every morning afterward when the bucket came its contents were at once handed over to <unk> and his friends who never ceased <unk> until nightfall our exceedingly <unk> meal of breadfruit over captain <unk> <unk> up to us with a couple of long poles hooked at one end and several large baskets of woven cocoanut branches not far off was an extensive grove of <unk> in full bearing and myself and another were selected to go with him and gather a supply for the party when we went in among the trees the <unk> of the orchard was unlike anything i had ever seen while the fragrance shaken from the gently waving boughs regaled our senses most <unk> in many places the trees formed a dense shade spreading overhead a dark rustling vault <unk> with boughs and <unk> here and there with the <unk> spheres like gilded balls in several places the <unk> branches were borne to the earth hiding the trunk in a tent of foliage once fairly in the grove we could see nothing else it was <unk> all round to preserve the fruit from <unk> <unk> <unk> the twigs with his pole let them fall into his basket but this would not do for us seizing hold of a bough we brought such a shower to the ground that our old friend was fain to run from under heedless of <unk> we then reclined in the shade and <unk> to our hearts content <unk> up the baskets afterwards we returned to our comrades by whom our arrival was hailed with loud <unk> and in a <unk> short time nothing was left of the <unk> we brought but the <unk> while inmates of the <unk> we had as much of the fruit as we wanted and to this cause and others that might be mentioned may be ascribed the speedy <unk> of our sick to comparative health the orange of tahiti is <unk> and sweet with a thin dry rind though now abounding it was unknown before cooks time to whom the natives are indebted for so great a blessing he likewise introduced several other kinds of fruit among these were the <unk> <unk> and <unk> now seldom met with the lime still grows and some of the <unk> natives express the juice to sell to the shipping it is highly <unk> as an <unk> nor was the variety of foreign fruits and <unk> which were introduced the only benefit conferred by the first visitors to the society group cattle and sheep were left at various places more of them anon thus after all that of late years has been done for these islanders cook and <unk> may in one sense at least be considered their greatest <unk> chapter xxxii proceedings of the french at tahiti as i happened to arrive at the island at a very interesting period in its political affairs it may be well to give some little account here of the proceedings of the french by way of <unk> to the narrative my information was obtained at the time from the general reports then rife among the natives as well as from what i learned upon a subsequent visit and reliable accounts which i have seen since reaching home it seems that for some time back the french had been making repeated <unk> attempts to plant a roman catholic mission here but invariably treated with <unk> they sometimes met with open violence and in every case those directly concerned in the enterprise were ultimately forced to depart in one instance two priests <unk> and <unk> after enduring a series of <unk> were set upon by the natives <unk> and finally carried aboard a small <unk> schooner which eventually put them ashore at <unk> <unk> savage <unk> two thousand miles to the westward now that the <unk> english missionaries <unk> the <unk> of these priests is a fact <unk> by themselves i was also repeatedly informed that by their <unk> <unk> they <unk> the <unk> which preceded the sailing of the schooner at all events it is certain that their unbounded influence with the natives would easily have enabled them to prevent everything that took place on this occasion had they felt so inclined melancholy as such an example of <unk> on the part of <unk> missionaries must appear it is not the only one and by no means the most <unk> which might be presented but i forbear to mention any others since they have been more than hinted at by recent voyagers and their repetition here would perhaps be attended with no good effect besides the conduct of the sandwich island missionaries in particular has <unk> much <unk> in this respect the treatment of the two priests formed the principal ground and the only <unk> one upon which <unk> <unk> <unk> demanded satisfaction and which subsequently led to his <unk> of the island in addition to other things he also charged that the flag of <unk> the <unk> had been repeatedly insulted and the property of a certain french <unk> violently <unk> by the government in the latter instance the natives were perfectly in the right at that time the law against the <unk> in ardent spirits every now and then suspended and revived happened to be in force and finding a large quantity on the premises of victor a low <unk> adventurer from <unk> the <unk> pronounced it <unk> for these and similar alleged outrages a large pecuniary <unk> was demanded <unk> dollars which there being no <unk> to supply the island was forthwith seized under cover of a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the chiefs on the gundeck of <unk> <unk> <unk> frigate but notwithstanding this <unk> there seems now little doubt that the <unk> of the <unk> was decided upon at the <unk> after <unk> the <unk> so called the <unk> sailed leaving <unk> <unk> governor assisted by <unk> and <unk> <unk> named members of the <unk> of government and <unk> the <unk> now made <unk> royal no soldiers however were landed until several months afterward as men <unk> and <unk> were not <unk> by the natives but <unk> and <unk> they bitterly <unk> in several <unk> with the poor queen the <unk> governor sought to <unk> her into compliance with his demands clapping his hand upon his sword shaking his fist in her face and swearing violently oh king of a great nation said <unk> in her letter to louis <unk> fetch away this man i and my people cannot endure his evil <unk> he is a <unk> man although the excitement among the natives did not wholly <unk> upon the <unk> departure no <unk> act of violence immediately followed the queen had fled to <unk> and the <unk> among the chiefs together with the <unk> conduct of the missionaries prevented a union upon some common plan of resistance but the great body of the people as well as their queen <unk> relied upon the speedy <unk> of <unk> nation bound to them by many ties and which more than once had solemnly <unk> their independence as for the missionaries they openly <unk> the french governor <unk> <unk> fleets and armies from britain but what is the welfare of a spot like tahiti to the mighty interests of france and england there was a <unk> on one side and a reply on the other and there the matter rested for once in their <unk> lives st george and st <unk> were hand and <unk> and they were not going to cross <unk> about tahiti during my stay upon the island so far as i could see there was little to denote that any change had taken place in the government such laws as they had were administered the same as ever the missionaries went about unmolested and comparative tranquillity everywhere prevailed nevertheless i sometimes heard the natives <unk> against the french no <unk> by the <unk> throughout polynesia and bitterly <unk> that the queen had not at the outset made a stand in the house of the chief <unk> frequent <unk> took place concerning the <unk> of the island to <unk> with the french the number of fighting men and muskets among the natives were talked of as well as the propriety of <unk> several heights overlooking <unk> <unk> these symptoms to the mere resentment of a recent <unk> and not to any determined spirit of resistance i little anticipated the gallant though useless warfare so soon to follow my departure at a period subsequent to my first visit the island which before was divided into <unk> <unk> with a native chief over each in capacity of governor and judge was by <unk> divided into four over these he set as many <unk> chiefs <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to whom he paid <unk> dollars each to secure their assistance in carrying out his evil designs the first blood shed in any regular conflict was at <unk> upon the <unk> of <unk> the fight originated in the <unk> of a number of women from the shore by men belonging to one of the french vessels of war in this affair the islanders fought desperately killing about fifty of the enemy and losing ninety of their own number the french sailors and marines who at the time were reported to be <unk> with liquor gave no quarter and the survivors only saved themselves by fleeing to the mountains subsequently the battles of <unk> and <unk> were fought in which the invaders met with indifferent success shortly after the engagement at <unk> three <unk> were <unk> in a pass of the valleys and murdered by the incensed natives one was <unk> a notorious <unk> and a spy whom <unk> had sent to conduct a certain major <unk> said to be a pole to the <unk> of four chiefs whom the governor wished to seize and execute this circumstance violently inflamed the hostility of both parties about this time <unk> a <unk> chief and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> was induced by him to give a great feast in the vale of <unk> to which all his countrymen were invited the <unk> object was to gain over all he could to his interests he supplied an abundance of wine and brandy and a scene of <unk> <unk> was the natural consequence before it came to this however several <unk> were made by the islanders one of these delivered by an aged warrior who had formerly been at the head of the celebrated <unk> society was characteristic this is a very good feast said the reeling old man and the wine also is very good but you <unk> <unk> french and you <unk> men of tahiti are all very bad by the <unk> accounts most of the islanders still refuse to submit to the french and what turn events may hereafter take it is hard to <unk> at any rate these <unk> must <unk> the final <unk> of their race along with the few officers left by <unk> <unk> <unk> were several french priests for whose unobstructed exertions in the <unk> of their faith the strongest <unk> were provided by an article of the <unk> but no one was bound to offer them <unk> much less a <unk> the first day they went ashore true they had plenty of gold but to the natives it was <unk> for several hours and some odd minutes they would not touch it <unk> of the <unk> and the devil as the strangers were <unk> smell of <unk> hardly yet shaken out of their <unk> islander would venture to <unk> his soul and call down a <unk> on his breadfruit by holding any intercourse with them that morning the priests actually <unk> in grove of cocoanut trees but before night christian <unk> exchange for a <unk> equivalent of hard <unk> given them in an adjoining house wanting in civility as the conduct of the english missionaries may be thought in <unk> a decent reception to these persons the latter were certainly to blame in <unk> placing themselves in so unpleasant a <unk> under far better <unk> they might have settled upon some one of the thousand <unk> isles of the pacific rather than have forced themselves thus upon a people already <unk> christians chapter <unk> we receive calls at the <unk> de <unk> our place of confinement being open all round and so near the <unk> road of course we were in plain sight of everybody passing and therefore we had no lack of visitors among such an idle <unk> set as the <unk> for a few days they were coming and going continually while thus <unk> fast by the foot we were fain to give passive audience during this period we were the lions of the <unk> and no doubt strangers from the distant villages were taken to see the <unk> white men in the same way that countrymen in a city are <unk> to the <unk> gardens all this gave us a fine opportunity of making observations i was painfully struck by the considerable number of sickly or <unk> persons undoubtedly made so by a <unk> complaint which under native treatment almost invariably <unk> in the end the muscles and bones of the body in particular there is a <unk> of the back most <unk> to behold <unk> in a horrible form of the malady although this and other bodily <unk> were unknown before the discovery of the islands by the whites there are several cases found of the <unk> or <unk> native disease which seems to have prevailed among them from the earliest antiquity affecting the legs and feet alone it swells them in some instances to the girth of a mans body covering the skin with scales it might be supposed that one thus afflicted would be incapable of walking but to all appearance they seem to be nearly as active as anybody apparently suffering no pain and bearing the calamity with a degree of <unk> truly marvellous the <unk> is very gradual in its <unk> and years elapse before the limb is fully <unk> its origin is ascribed by the natives to various causes but the general impression seems to be that it <unk> in most cases from the eating of <unk> breadfruit and indian <unk> so far as i could find out it is not hereditary in no stage do they attempt a cure the complaint being held incurable speaking of the <unk> reminds me of a poor fellow a sailor whom i afterward saw at <unk> a lone island some two days sail from tahiti the island is very small and its inhabitants nearly extinct we sent a boat off to see whether any yams were to be had as formerly the yams of <unk> were as famous among the islands round about as <unk> <unk> in the mediterranean going ashore to my surprise i was accosted near a little <unk> of a church by a white man who <unk> forth from a wretched hut his hair and beard were <unk> his face deadly pale and haggard and one limb swelled with the <unk> to an incredible <unk> this was the first instance of a <unk> suffering from it that i had ever seen or heard of and the spectacle shocked me accordingly he had been there for years from the first symptoms he could not believe his complaint to be what it really was and trusted it would soon disappear but when it became plain that his only chance for <unk> was a speedy change of climate no ship would receive him as a sailor to think of being taken as a passenger was idle this speaks little for the humanity of sea captains but the truth is that those in the pacific have little enough of the virtue and nowadays when so many charitable <unk> are made to them they have become <unk> i <unk> the poor fellow from the bottom of my heart but nothing could i do as our captain was <unk> why said he here we <unk> on a six months <unk> cant put back and he is better off on the island than at sea so on <unk> he must die and probably he did i afterwards heard of this melancholy object from two seamen his attempts to leave were still <unk> and his hard fate was fast closing in notwithstanding the physical <unk> of the <unk> as a people among the chiefs individuals of <unk> figures are still frequently met with and occasionally <unk> men and diminutive women as lovely as the nymphs who nearly a century ago swam round the ships of <unk> in these instances <unk> beauty is quite as <unk> as it proved to the crew of the bounty the young girls being just such creatures as a poet would picture in the <unk> plump and <unk> the natural complexion of both <unk> is quite light but the <unk> appear much darker from their exposure to the sun a dark complexion however in a man is highly esteemed as <unk> strength of both body and soul hence there is a saying of great antiquity among them if dark the cheek of the mother the son will sound the <unk> if strong her frame he will give laws with this idea of <unk> no wonder the <unk> regarded all pale and <unk> europeans as weak and feminine whereas a sailor with a cheek like the breast of a roast turkey is held a lad of <unk> to use their own phrase a <unk> <unk> or man of bones speaking of bones <unk> an ugly custom of theirs now <unk> of making <unk> and <unk> out of those of their enemies this beats the <unk> turning peoples skulls into cups and <unk> but to return to the <unk> <unk> immense was the interest we excited among the throngs that called there they would stand talking about us by the hour growing most <unk> excited too and dancing up and down with all the <unk> of their race they invariably <unk> with us flying out against the <unk> and denouncing him as <unk> <unk> nuee or very bad exceedingly they must have borne him some grudge or other nor were the women sweet souls at all backward in visiting indeed they manifested even more interest than the men gazing at us with eyes full of a thousand meanings and conversing with marvellous rapidity but alas <unk> though they were and doubtless taking some passing <unk> on us there was little real feeling in them after all and still less sentimental sympathy many of them laughed outright at us noting only what was ridiculous in our plight i think it was the second day of our confinement that a wild beautiful girl burst into the <unk> and throwing herself into an arch attitude stood afar off and gazed at us she was a heartless <unk> to death with black <unk> nursing his <unk> <unk> and <unk> in certain moral reflections on the <unk> and captain <unk> after laughing her fill at him she <unk> to notice the rest glancing from one to another in the most <unk> and <unk> manner imaginable whenever anything struck her <unk> you saw it like a <unk> finger levelled <unk> and flinging herself back she gave loose to strange hollow little notes of laughter that sounded like the bass of a <unk> playing a lively air with the lid down now i knew not that there was anything in my own appearance calculated to <unk> <unk> and indeed to have looked at all heroic under the circumstances would have been rather difficult still i could not but feel exceedingly annoyed at the prospect of being <unk> at in turn by this mischievous young witch even though she were but an islander and to tell a secret her beauty had something to do with this sort of feeling and pinioned as i was to a log and clad most <unk> i began to grow sentimental ere her glance fell upon me i had unconsciously thrown myself into the most graceful attitude i could assume leaned my head upon my hand and summoned up as <unk> an expression as possible though my face was averted i soon felt it flush and knew that the glance was on me deeper and deeper grew the flush and not a sound of laughter delicious thought she was moved at the sight of me i could stand it no longer but started up lo there she was her great <unk> eyes rounding and rounding in her head like two stars her whole frame in a merry <unk> and an expression about the mouth that was sudden and violent death to anything like sentiment the next moment she spun round and bursting from <unk> to <unk> of laughter went <unk> out of the <unk> and in mercy to me never returned chapter <unk> life at the <unk> a few days passed and at last our <unk> was <unk> by some indulgence on the part of captain <unk> he allowed the entire party to be at large during the day only <unk> upon us always to keep within hail this to be sure was in positive <unk> to <unk> orders and so care had to be taken that he should not hear of it there was little fear of the natives telling him but strangers travelling the <unk> road might by way of precaution boys were stationed as scouts along the road at sight of a white man they sounded the alarm when we all made for our respective holes the stocks being purposely left open the beam then descended and we were prisoners as soon as the traveller was out of sight of course we were liberated notwithstanding the regular supply of food which we obtained from captain <unk> and his friends it was so small that we often felt most intolerably hungry we could not blame them for not bringing us more for we soon became aware that they had to pinch themselves in order to give us what they did besides they received nothing for their kindness but the daily bucket of bread among a people like the <unk> what we call hard times can only be experienced in the <unk> of <unk> yet so destitute are many of the common people that this most <unk> consequence of civilization may be said with them to be ever present to be sure the natives about the <unk> had abundance of <unk> and <unk> but what were these good for except to impart a still <unk> edge to <unk> which there was so little else to gratify during the height of the breadfruit season they fare better but at other times the demands of the shipping <unk> the <unk> resources of the island and the lands being mostly owned by the chiefs the inferior orders have to suffer for their <unk> deprived of their <unk> many of them would starve as captain <unk> insensibly <unk> his <unk> and we began to stroll farther and farther from the <unk> we managed by a systematic <unk> upon the country round about to make up some of our <unk> and fortunate it was that the houses of the <unk> natives were just as open to us as those of the most destitute we were treated as kindly in one as the other once in a while we came in at the death of a chiefs pig the noise of whose <unk> was generally to be heard at a great distance an occasion like this <unk> the <unk> together and they have a bit of a feast where a stranger is always welcome a good loud <unk> therefore was music in our ears it showed something going on in that direction breaking in upon the party <unk> as we did we always created a sensation sometimes we found the animal still alive and struggling in which case it was generally dropped at our approach to provide for these emergencies flash jack generally repaired to the scene of operations with a <unk> between his teeth and a club in his hand others were exceedingly <unk> in <unk> off the <unk> and <unk> doctor long ghost and myself however never <unk> with these preliminaries but came to the feast itself with <unk> <unk> like all lank men my long friend had an appetite of his own others occasionally went about seeking what they might <unk> but he was always on the alert he had an ingenious way of <unk> an <unk> which we all experienced at times the islanders seldom use salt with their food so he begged rope yarn to bring him some from the ship also a little <unk> if he could which accordingly was done this he placed in a small leather <unk> monkey bag so called by <unk> worn as a purse about the neck in my opinion said long ghost as he tucked the <unk> out of sight it <unk> a stranger in tahiti to have his knife in readiness and his <unk> slung chapter <unk> visit from an old acquaintance we had not been many days ashore when doctor johnson was espied coming along the <unk> road we had heard that he <unk> a visit and suspected what he was after being upon the <unk> hands all our <unk> were of course <unk> by him in his official capacity and therefore as a friend of <unk> and sure of good pay the shore doctor had some idea of <unk> us to run up a bill with him true it was rather <unk> to ask us to take <unk> which on board the ship he told us were not needed however he resolved to put a bold face on the matter and give us a call his approach was announced by one of the scouts upon which <unk> suggested that we should let him enter and then put him in the stocks but long ghost proposed better sport what it was we shall presently see very bland and amiable doctor johnson advanced and resting his cane on the stocks glanced to right and left as we lay before him well my <unk> <unk> do you find yourselves today looking very <unk> the men made some rejoinder and he went on those poor fellows i saw the other <unk> sick i <unk> are they and he <unk> the company at last he <unk> out one who was assuming a most unearthly appearance and remarked that he looked as if he were extremely ill yes said the sailor <unk> im <unk> doctor ill soon be losing the number of my mess a sea phrase for departing this life and he closed his eyes and <unk> what does he say said johnson turning round eagerly why exclaimed flash jack who volunteered as <unk> he means hes going to <unk> die <unk> and what does that mean applied to a patient oh i understand said he when the word was explained and he stepped over the stocks and felt the mans pulse whats his name he asked turning this time to old navy <unk> we calls him jingling joe replied that worthy well then men you must take good care of poor <unk> and i will send him a powder which must be taken according to the directions some of you know how to read i presume that ere young <unk> does replied <unk> pointing toward the place where i lay as if he were directing attention to a sail at sea after examining the <unk> of whom were really invalids but <unk> and others only pretending to be <unk> under divers <unk> johnson turned round and addressed the party men said he if any more of you are <unk> speak up and let me know by order of the <unk> im to call every day so if any of you are at all sick its my duty to <unk> for you this sudden change from ship fare to shore living plays the <unk> with you sailors so be cautious about eating fruit <unk> ill send you the <unk> the first thing in the morning now i am inclined to suspect that with all his want of understanding johnson must have had some idea that we were <unk> him still that was nothing so long as it answered his purpose and therefore if he did see through us he never showed it sure enough at the time appointed along came a native lad with a small basket of cocoanut <unk> filled with <unk> <unk> <unk> each with names and directions written in a large round hand the sailors one and all made a snatch at the collection under the strange impression that some of the <unk> were <unk> with spirits but <unk> his privilege as physician to the first reading of the <unk> doctor long ghost was at last permitted to take possession of the basket the first thing lighted upon was a large vial <unk> <unk> well in this vial certainly had a <unk> smell and upon handing it to the patient he made a summary internal application of its contents the doctor looked aghast there was now a mighty commotion <unk> and pills were <unk> mere <unk> in the market and the <unk> of <unk> were pronounced lucky dogs johnson must have known enough of sailors to make some of his <unk> <unk> at least long ghost suspected certain it was <unk> took to the <unk> if at all spicy directions were unheeded their contents all going one road the largest one of all quite a bottle indeed and having a sort of burnt brandy <unk> was <unk> daniel drink freely and until relieved this black dan proceeded to do and would have made an end of it at once had not the bottle after a hard struggle been snatched from his hands and passed round like a jovial <unk> the old tar had complained of the effects of an <unk> eating of fruit upon calling the following morning our physician found his precious row of <unk> reclining behind the stocks and doing as well as could be expected but the pills and <unk> were found to have been perfectly <unk> probably because none had been taken to make them <unk> it was suggested that for the future a bottle of <unk> should be sent along with them according to flash jacks notions <unk> <unk> <unk> were but dry stuff at the best and needed something good to wash them down thus far our own <unk> doctor long ghost after starting the frolic had taken no further part in it but on the <unk> third visit he took him to one side and had a private <unk> what it was exactly we could not tell but from certain <unk> signs and gestures i fancied that he was describing the symptoms of some mysterious <unk> of the <unk> which must have come on within the hour assisted by his familiarity with <unk> terms he seemed to produce a marked impression at last johnson went his way promising aloud that he would send long ghost what he desired when the medicine boy came along the following morning the doctor was the first to <unk> him walking off with a small purple vial this time there was little else in the basket but a <unk> of the burnt brandy cordial which after much <unk> was finally disposed of by <unk> pouring the contents little by little into the half of a cocoanut shell and so giving all who desired a glass no further <unk> cheer remaining the men dispersed an hour or two passed when flash jack directed attention to my long friend who since the medicine boy left had not been noticed till now with eyes closed he was lying behind the stocks and jack was lifting his arm and letting it fall as if life were extinct on running up with the rest i at once connected the phenomenon with the mysterious vial searching his pocket i found it and holding it up it proved to be <unk> flash jack snatching it from my hand in a rapture quickly informed all present what it was and with much glee proposed a nap for the company some of them not <unk> him exactly the apparently <unk> long <unk> lay so still that i a little suspected the <unk> of his <unk> rolled about as an illustration of the virtues of the <unk> contents the idea <unk> everybody <unk> and throwing themselves down the magic draught was passed from hand to hand thinking that as a matter of course they must at once become insensible each man upon taking his sip fell back and closed his eyes there was little fear of the result since the <unk> was equally distributed but curious to see how it would operate i raised myself gently after a while and looked around it was about noon and perfectly still and as we all daily took the <unk> i was not much surprised to find <unk> quiet still in one or two instances i thought i detected a little peeping presently i heard a <unk> and saw doctor johnson approaching and perplexed enough did he look at the sight of his prostrate file of <unk> plunged apparently in such unaccountable slumbers daniel he cried at last <unk> in the side with his cane the individual thus <unk> my good fellow get up do you hear but black dan was immovable and he <unk> the next sleeper <unk> <unk> come wake up its me doctor johnson but jingling joe with mouth open and eyes shut was not to be started bless my soul he exclaimed with uplifted hands and cane whats got into em i say <unk> shouted running up and <unk> to life men what under the suns the matter with you and he struck the stocks and <unk> with increased <unk> at last he paused folded his hands over the head of his cane and steadfastly gazed upon us the notes of the <unk> <unk> were rising and falling upon his ear and a new idea suggested itself yes yes the rascals must have been getting <unk> well its none of my <unk> be off and off he went no sooner was he out of sight than nearly all started to their feet and a hearty laugh ensued like myself most of them had been watching the event from under a sly <unk> by this time too doctor long ghost was as wide awake as anybody what were his reasons for taking <unk> indeed he took any <unk> best known to himself and as it is neither mine nor the readers business we will say no more about it chapter <unk> we are carried before the <unk> and captain we had been inmates of the <unk> <unk> about two weeks when one morning captain <unk> coming from the bath in a state of utter <unk> brought into the building an <unk> of old tappa and began to dress to go out the operation was quite simple the <unk> the <unk> <unk> in one long heavy piece and fastening one end to a column of <unk> wood supporting the <unk> he went off a few paces and putting the other about his waist wound himself right up to the post this <unk> costume in <unk> something like a <unk> added <unk> to his large <unk> so much so that he fairly <unk> in his gait but he was only adhering to the fashion of his fathers for in the <unk> time the <unk> or big girdle was quite the mode for both <unk> <unk> <unk> recent <unk> still clung to it he was a gentleman of the old <unk> of the last of the <unk> he now told us that he had orders to take us before the <unk> nothing loth we formed in procession and with the old man at our head <unk> and <unk> like an <unk> and <unk> by a guard of some twenty natives we started for the village arrived at the <unk> office we found <unk> there and four or five europeans seated in a row facing us probably with the view of presenting as judicial an appearance as possible on one side was a couch where captain <unk> reclined he looked <unk> and as we found out intended soon to go aboard his ship he said nothing but left everything to the <unk> the latter now rose and drawing forth a paper from a large roll tied with red <unk> commenced reading aloud it <unk> to be the <unk> of john <unk> first officer of the british <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> master and proved to be a long statement of matters from the time of leaving <unk> down to our arrival in the harbour though <unk> drawn up so as to bear hard against every one of us it was pretty correct in the de tails excepting that it was wholly silent as to the manifold <unk> of the mate <unk> fact which imparted unusual significance to the concluding sentence and furthermore this deponent <unk> not no <unk> were made although we all looked round for the mate to see whether it was possible that he could have <unk> this use of his name but he was not present the next document produced was the <unk> of the captain himself as on all other occasions however he had very little to say for himself and it was soon set aside the third <unk> was that of the seamen remaining aboard the vessel including the traitor <unk> who it seemed had turned ships evidence it was an <unk> piece of <unk> from beginning to end and those who signed it could not have known what they were about certainly <unk> did not though his mark was there in vain the <unk> commanded silence during the reading of this paper <unk> were shouted out upon every <unk> the <unk> read <unk> who all the while looked as stiff as a <unk> solemnly drew forth the ships articles from their tin case this document was a <unk> musty <unk> affair and hard to read when finished the <unk> held it up and pointing to the marks of the ships company at the bottom asked us one by one whether we <unk> the same for our own whats the use of asking that said black dan captain <unk> there knows as well as we they are silence sir said <unk> who <unk> to produce a suitable impression by this ridiculous parade was not a little <unk> by the old sailors <unk> a pause of a few moments now ensued during which the bench of judges <unk> with captain <unk> in a low tone and the sailors <unk> the motives of the <unk> in having the <unk> taken the general idea seemed to be that it was done with a view of <unk> or <unk> us into submission such proved to be the case for <unk> rising to his feet again addressed us as follows you see men that every preparation has been made to send you to <unk> for trial the <unk> a small <unk> schooner lying in the harbour will sail for that place in the course of ten days at farthest the <unk> sails on a cruise this day week do you still refuse duty we did hereupon the <unk> and captain exchanged glances and the latter looked bitterly disappointed presently i noticed <unk> eye upon me and for the first time he spoke and told me to come near i stepped forward was it not you that was taken off the island it was it was you then who owe your life to my humanity yet this is the gratitude of a sailor mr <unk> not so sir and i at once gave him to understand that i was perfectly acquainted with his motives in sending a boat into the bay his crew was reduced and he merely wished to procure the sailor whom he expected to find there the ship was the means of my deliverance and no thanks to the benevolence of its captain doctor long ghost also had a word to say in two masterly sentences he <unk> up captain <unk> character to the complete satisfaction of every seaman present matters were now growing serious especially as the sailors became riotous and talked about taking the <unk> and the captain back to the <unk> with them the other judges <unk> and loudly commanded silence it was at length restored when <unk> for the last time addressing us said something more about the rose and <unk> and concluded by reminding us that a week would elapse ere the <unk> sailed leaving these hints to operate for themselves he dismissed the party ordering captain <unk> and his friends to escort us back whence we came chapter <unk> the french priests pay their respects a day or two after the events just related we were lounging in the <unk> <unk> when we were <unk> by a visit from three of the french priests and as about the only notice ever taken of us by the english missionaries was their leaving their cards for us in the shape of a package of <unk> we could not help thinking that the <unk> in making a personal call were at least much better bred by this time they had settled themselves down quite near our habitation a pleasant little stroll down the <unk> road and a rustic cross peeped through the trees and soon you came to as charming a place as one would wish to see a soft <unk> planted with old breadfruit trees in front a <unk> sloping to a grove of palms and between these glimpses of blue sunny waves on the summit of the <unk> was a rude chapel of bamboos quite small and surmounted by the cross between the canes at nightfall the natives stole <unk> at a small <unk> altar a <unk> to correspond and gilded <unk> and <unk> their curiosity carried them no further nothing could induce them to worship there such queer ideas as they entertained of the hated strangers masses and <unk> were nothing more than evil spells as for the priests themselves they were no better than diabolical sorcerers like those who in old times terrified their fathers close by the chapel was a range of native houses <unk> from a chief and <unk> furnished here lived the priests and very <unk> too they looked <unk> enough abroad but that went for nothing since at home in their retreat they were a club of <unk> <unk> holding <unk> <unk> over many a good cup of red brandy and rising late in the morning pity it was they couldnt <unk> for the ladies of the island i mean and the cause of <unk> for what business had the <unk> old bachelors with such a set of trim little native <unk> these damsels were their first <unk> and devoted ones they were the priests as i have said before were accounted <unk> the appearance of two of our three visitors might have justified the conceit they were little <unk> <unk> in long straight <unk> of black cloth and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> big that in putting them on the reverend fathers seemed to <unk> themselves their companion was dressed <unk> he wore a sort of yellow <unk> morning <unk> and a <unk> manilla hat large and portly he was also hale and fifty with a complexion like an autumnal <unk> blue <unk> teeth and a <unk> <unk> <unk> in short he was an <unk> father <unk> by name and as such pretty well known and very thoroughly <unk> throughout all the <unk> missionary settlements in polynesia in early youth he had been sent to a religious <unk> in france and taking orders there had but once or twice afterwards <unk> his native land father <unk> marched up to us briskly and the first words he uttered were to ask whether there were any of his countrymen among us there were two of them one a lad of <unk> bright <unk> <unk> being a young <unk> of course his name was <unk> the other was an ugly and rather <unk> <unk> one <unk> whose prospects in life had been blasted by a premature <unk> to <unk> this was the report at least though it might have been <unk> in most of my shipmates were some <unk> qualities but about <unk> there was nothing of the kind and forced to consort with him i could not help <unk> a thousand times that the gallows had been so <unk> as if impelled against her will to send him into the world nature had done all she could to insure his being taken for what he was about the eyes there was no <unk> him with a villainous cast in one they seemed suspicious of each other glancing away from him at once the bluff priest rested his gaze on the <unk> face of <unk> who with a pleasant <unk> was <unk> the enormous hats or <unk> <unk> as land <unk> are called by sailors from under which like a couple of <unk> peeped the two little <unk> <unk> and the priest were both from the same town in <unk> and when this was found out there was no end to the questions of the latter to him <unk> seemed a letter from home and said a hundred times as much after a long talk between these two and a little broken english from the <unk> our visitors took leave but father <unk> had hardly gone a dozen rods when back he came inquiring whether we were in want of anything yes cried one something to eat upon this he promised to send us some fresh <unk> bread of his own <unk> a great luxury in tahiti we all <unk> <unk> upon picking up such a friend and told him his fortune was made the next morning a french servant of the priests made his appearance with a small bundle of clothing for our young <unk> and the promised bread for the party <unk> being out at the knees and elbows and like the rest of us not full inside the present was <unk> all round in the afternoon father <unk> himself came along and in addition to his previous gifts gave <unk> a good deal of advice said he was sorry to see him in <unk> and that he would have a talk with the <unk> about having him set free we saw nothing more of him for two or three days at the end of which time he paid us another call telling <unk> that <unk> was <unk> having refused to set him at liberty unless to go aboard the ship this the priest now besought him to do forthwith and so escape the punishment which it seems <unk> had been hinting at to his <unk> <unk> however was <unk> against entreaties and with all the <unk> of a <unk> sailor protested his intention to hold out to the last with none of the <unk> of a good little boy about him the <unk> youngster stormed away at such a rate that it was hard to <unk> him and the priest said no more how it came to <unk> from <unk> speaking to the <unk> or otherwise we could not <unk> the next day <unk> was sent for by <unk> and being escorted to the village by our good old <unk> three days elapsed before he returned bent upon <unk> him they had taken him on board the ship <unk> him in the cabin and finding that of no avail down they thrust him into the hold in double irons and on bread and water all would not do and so he was sent back to the <unk> boy that he was they must have counted upon his being more susceptible to discipline than the rest the interest felt in <unk> welfare by his benevolent countryman was very serviceable to the rest of us especially as we all turned <unk> and went to mass every morning much to captain <unk> consternation upon finding it out he threatened to keep us in the stocks if we did not desist he went no farther than this though and so every few days we strolled down to the priests residence and had a mouthful to eat and something generous to drink in particular dr long ghost and myself became huge <unk> with <unk> friend and many a time he regaled us from a <unk> travelling case for spirits stowed away in one corner of his dwelling it held four square flasks which somehow or other always contained just enough to need <unk> in truth the fine old <unk> was a rosy fellow in <unk> his countenance and his soul were always in a glow it may be <unk> to reveal his <unk> but he often talked thick and sometimes was <unk> eccentric in his gait i never drink french brandy but i pledge father <unk> his health again and many jolly <unk> may he make in polynesia chapter <unk> little <unk> sails without us to make good the hint thrown out by the <unk> upon the conclusion of the <unk> of the <unk> we were again brought before him within the time <unk> it was the same thing over again he got nothing out of us and we were <unk> our resolute behaviour annoying him <unk> what we observed led us to form the idea that on first learning the state of affairs on board the <unk> <unk> must have addressed his invalid friend the captain something in the following style <unk> my poor fellow dont <unk> yourself now about those <unk> sailors of yours ill dress them out for <unk> leave it all to me and set your mind at rest but <unk> and stocks big looks threats dark hints and <unk> had all gone for <unk> conscious that as matters now stood nothing serious could grow out of what had happened and never dreaming that our being sent home for trial had ever been really thought of we thoroughly understood <unk> and laughed at him accordingly since leaving the <unk> we had caught no glimpse of the mate but we often heard of him it seemed that he remained on board keeping house in the cabin for himself and <unk> who going to see him according to promise was induced to remain a guest these two <unk> now had fine times tapping the captains <unk> playing cards on the transom and giving balls of an evening to the ladies ashore in short they cut up so many queer <unk> that the missionaries complained of them to the <unk> and <unk> received a sharp reprimand this so affected him that he still drank more freely than before and one afternoon when mellow as a grape he took <unk> at a canoe full of natives who on being hailed from the deck to come aboard and show their papers got frightened and paddled for the shore lowering a boat instantly he <unk> <unk> and the <unk> with a cutlass <unk> and seizing another himself off they started in pursuit the ships ensign flying in the boats stern the alarmed islanders <unk> their canoe with loud cries fled through the village the mate after them <unk> his naked weapon to right and left a crowd soon collected and the <unk> <unk> or crazy stranger was quickly taken before <unk> now it so chanced that in a native house hard by the <unk> and captain <unk> were having a quiet game at <unk> by themselves a <unk> on the table standing sentry the obstreperous <unk> was brought in and finding the two thus pleasantly occupied it had a soothing effect upon him and he insisted upon taking a hand at the cards and a drink of the brandy as the <unk> was nearly as <unk> as himself and the captain dared not object for fear of giving offence at it they <unk> three of <unk> made a night of it the mates <unk> being <unk> passed over and his <unk> sent away an incident worth relating grew out of this <unk> there wandered about <unk> at this time a <unk> little fright of an <unk> known among sailors as old mother tot from new zealand to the sandwich islands she had been all over the south seas keeping a rude hut of entertainment for mariners and <unk> them with <unk> and dice upon the missionary islands of course such conduct was severely <unk> and at various places mother <unk> establishment had been shut up and its proprietor made to quit in the first vessel that could be hired to land her elsewhere but with a perseverance invincible wherever she went she always started afresh and so became notorious everywhere by some wicked spell of hers a patient oneeyed little <unk> followed her about mending shoes for white men doing the old womans cooking and bearing all her abuse without <unk> strange to relate a battered bible was seldom out of his sight and whenever he had leisure and his <unk> back was turned he was forever <unk> over it this pious <unk> used to <unk> the old <unk> past belief and oftentimes she <unk> his ears with the book and tried to burn it mother tot and her man <unk> were indeed a curious pair but to my story a week or so after our arrival in the harbour the old lady had once again been hunted down and forced for the time to abandon her <unk> calling this was brought about chiefly by <unk> who for some reason unknown had contracted the most violent hatred for her which on her part was more than <unk> well passing in the evening where the <unk> and his party were making merry she peeped through the bamboos of the house and straightway resolved to gratify her spite the night was very dark and <unk> herself with a huge ships lantern which usually swung in her hut she waited till they came forth this happened about midnight <unk> making his appearance supported by two natives holding him up by the arms these three went first and just as they got under a deep shade a bright light was thrust within an inch of <unk> nose the old <unk> was kneeling before him holding the lantern with uplifted hands ha ha my fine <unk> she shrieked ye <unk> a lone old body like me for selling <unk> ye and here ye are carried home <unk> ye villain i scorn ye and she <unk> upon him terrified at the apparition the poor <unk> <unk> in <unk> the trembling <unk> and fled in all directions after giving full vent to her rage mother tot hobbled away and left the three <unk> to <unk> home the best way they could the day following our last interview with <unk> we learned that captain <unk> had gone on board his vessel for the purpose of shipping a new crew there was a round bounty offered and a heavy bag of spanish dollars with the <unk> articles ready for <unk> were laid on the <unk> now there was no lack of idle sailors ashore mostly <unk> who had formed themselves into an <unk> gang headed by one <unk> a <unk> whom they styled the commodore by the laws of the <unk> no member was allowed to ship on board a vessel unless granted permission by the rest in this way the gang <unk> the port all discharged seamen being forced to join them to <unk> and his men our story was well known indeed they had several times called to see us and of course as sailors and congenial spirits they were hard against captain <unk> deeming the matter important they came in a body to the <unk> and wished to know whether all things considered we thought it best for any of them to join the <unk> anxious to pack the ship off as soon as possible we answered by all means some went so far as to <unk> the <unk> to the skies as the best and <unk> of ships <unk> too as a good fellow and a sailor every inch came in for his share of praise and as for the <unk> man he would never trouble <unk> in short every inducement we could think of was presented and <unk> jack ended by assuring the <unk> solemnly that now we were all well and hearty nothing but a regard to principle prevented us from returning on board ourselves the result was that a new crew was finally obtained together with a steady new <unk> for second mate and three good whalemen for <unk> in part what was wanting for the ships larder was also supplied and as far as could be done in a place like tahiti the <unk> the vessel had sustained were repaired as for the <unk> the authorities <unk> to let him be put ashore he was carried to sea in irons down in the hold what eventually became of him we never heard <unk> poor poor <unk> who a few days previous had fallen sick was left ashore at the sailor hospital at <unk> a small place upon the beach between <unk> and <unk> here some time after he breathed his last no one knew his complaint he must have died of hard times several of us saw him <unk> in the sand and i planted a rude post to mark his <unk> the cooper and the rest who had remained aboard from the first of course composed part of the <unk> new crew to account for the conduct all along of the <unk> and captain in trying so hard to <unk> our purpose with respect to the ship the following statement is all that is requisite beside an advance of from fifteen to twentyfive dollars demanded by every sailor shipping at tahiti an additional sum for each man so shipped has to be paid into the hands of the government as a charge of the port beside this the <unk> here and there an <unk> only ship for one cruise thus becoming entitled to a discharge before the vessel <unk> home which in time <unk> the necessity of <unk> other men at a similar cost now the <unk> <unk> was at <unk> mark or rather it was quite empty and to meet these <unk> a good part of what little oil there was aboard had to be sold for a song to a merchant of <unk> it was sunday in tahiti and a glorious morning when captain <unk> <unk> into the <unk> startled us by announcing <unk> <unk> you <unk> sail in other words the <unk> was off the beach was quite near and in this quarter altogether uninhabited so down we ran and at cables length saw little <unk> gliding <unk> hoisting and a boy aloft with one leg thrown over the yard <unk> the <unk> the decks were all life and commotion the sailors on the forecastle singing ho <unk> men as they <unk> the anchor and the gallant <unk> bareheaded as his wont standing up on the bowsprit and issuing his orders by the man at the helm stood captain <unk> very quiet and gentlemanly and smoking a cigar soon the ship drew near the reef and altering her course glided out through the break and went on her way thus disappeared little <unk> about three weeks after entering the harbour and nothing more have i ever heard of her chapter xxxix <unk> serves us a good <unk> in polynesia the ship out of the way we were quite anxious to know what was going to be done with us on this head captain <unk> could tell us nothing no further at least than that he still considered himself responsible for our <unk> however he never put us to bed any more and we had everything our own way the day after the <unk> left the old man came up to us in great <unk> saying that the bucket of bread was no longer <unk> and that <unk> had refused to send anything in its place one and all we took this for a hint to <unk> quietly and go about our business nevertheless we were not to be shaken off so easily and taking a malicious pleasure in annoying our old enemy we resolved for the present to stay where we were for the part he had been acting we learned that the <unk> was the <unk> of all the foreigners ashore who frequently <unk> him upon his hopeful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as we were wholly without resources so long as we remained on the island no better place than captain <unk> could be selected for an <unk> beside we heartily loved the old gentleman and could not think of leaving him so telling him to give no thought as to <unk> we should be clothed and fed we resolved by extending and <unk> our <unk> operations to provide for ourselves we were greatly assisted by a parting <unk> of <unk> to him we were indebted for having all our chests sent ashore and everything left therein they were placed in the custody of a petty chief living near by who was <unk> by the <unk> not to allow them to be taken away but we might call and make our <unk> whenever we pleased we went to see <unk> the old chief captain <unk> going along and stoutly <unk> upon having the <unk> delivered up at last this was done and in solemn procession the chests were borne by the natives to the <unk> here we disposed them about quite <unk> and made such a figure that in the eyes of old <unk> and his friends the <unk> <unk> was by far the most <unk> furnished <unk> in tahiti indeed so long as it remained thus furnished the native courts of the district were held there the judge <unk> and his associates sitting upon one of the chests and the culprits and spectators thrown at full length upon the ground both inside of the building and under the shade of the trees without while leaning over the stocks as from a gallery the worshipful crew of the <unk> looked on and <unk> the proceedings i should have mentioned before that previous to the vessels departure the men had <unk> away all the clothing they could possibly spare but now it was resolved to be more <unk> the contents of the chests were of the most miscellaneous <unk> <unk> <unk> strips of calico bits of rope <unk> nearly everything in short that a seaman could think of but of wearing apparel there was little but old frocks <unk> of jackets and legs of <unk> with now and then the foot of a <unk> these however were far from being <unk> for among the <unk> <unk> everything european is highly esteemed they come from <unk> <unk> <unk> britain land of wonders and that is enough the chests themselves were deemed exceedingly precious especially those with <unk> looks which would absolutely <unk> and enable the owner to walk off with the key scars however and <unk> were considered great <unk> one old fellow smitten with the doctors large mahogany chest a <unk> one by the <unk> and finding infinite satisfaction in merely sitting thereon was detected in the act of applying a healing <unk> to a shocking <unk> which <unk> the beauty of the lid there is no telling the love of a <unk> for a sailors trunk so <unk> is it held as an article of furniture in the hut that the women are incessantly tormenting their husbands to <unk> themselves and make them a present of one when obtained no <unk> just placed in a <unk> is regarded with half the delight for these reasons then our coming into possession of our estate at this time was an important event the islanders are much like the rest of the world and the news of our good fortune brought us troops of <unk> or friends eager to form an alliance after the national custom and do our slightest bidding the really curious way in which all the polynesians are in the habit of making bosom friends at the <unk> possible notice is <unk> of remark although among a people like the <unk> <unk> as they are by <unk> influences this custom has in most cases <unk> into a mere <unk> relation it nevertheless had its origin in a fine and in some instances heroic sentiment formerly entertained by their fathers in the <unk> of the island are examples of extravagant <unk> <unk> by the story of <unk> and <unk> in truth much more wonderful for notwithstanding the <unk> of life in some <unk> which they led they were frequently entertained at first sight for some stranger from another island filled with love and admiration for the first whites who came among them the polynesians could not <unk> the warmth of their emotions more strongly than by <unk> making their abrupt <unk> of friendship hence in old voyages we read of chiefs coming off from the shore in their canoes and going through with strange <unk> expressive of the desire in the same way their <unk> accosted the seamen and thus the practice has continued in some islands down to the present day there is a small place not many days sail from tahiti and seldom visited by shipping where the vessel touched to which i then happened to belong of course among the <unk> natives we had a friend all round mine was <unk> a handsome youth who never could do enough for me every morning at sunrise his canoe came alongside loaded with fruits of all kinds upon being emptied it was secured by a line to the bowsprit under which it lay all day long ready at any time to carry its owner ashore on an errand seeing him so indefatigable i told <unk> one day that i was a <unk> in shells and <unk> of all kinds that was enough away he paddled for the head of the bay and i never saw him again for twentyfour hours the next morning his canoe came gliding slowly along the shore with the <unk> bough of a tree for a sail for the purpose of keeping the things dry he had also built a sort of platform just behind the prow railed in with green <unk> and here was a heap of yellow bananas and <unk> shells young cocoanuts and antlers of red coral two or three pieces of carved wood a little <unk> black as jet and rolls of printed tappa we were given a holiday and upon going ashore <unk> of course was my companion and guide for this no mortal could be better qualified his native country was not large and he knew every inch of it <unk> me about <unk> was stopped and <unk> introduced to <unk> <unk> <unk> nuee or his particular white friend he showed me all the lions but more than all he took me to see a charming <unk> young <unk> daughter of a <unk> reputation of whose charms had spread to the neighbouring islands and even brought <unk> therefrom among these was <unk> the heir of <unk> king of <unk> one of the society isles the girl was certainly fair to look upon many heavens were in her sunny eyes and the outline of that arm of hers peeping forth from a capricious tappa robe was the very <unk> of beauty though there was no end to <unk> <unk> not a syllable did he ever breathe of reward but sometimes he looked very knowing at last the day came for sailing and with it also his canoe loaded down to the gunwale with a sea stock of fruits giving him all i could spare from my chest i went on deck to take my place at the windlass for the anchor was weighing <unk> followed and heaved with me at the same <unk> the anchor was soon up and away we went out of the bay with more than twenty shallops towing astern at last they left us but long as i could see him at all there was <unk> standing alone and motionless in the bow of his canoe part ii chapter <unk> we take unto ourselves friends the arrival of the chests made my friend the doctor by far the <unk> man of the party so much the better for me seeing that i had little or nothing myself though from our <unk> the natives <unk> my favour almost as much as his among others <unk> was a <unk> for my friendship and being a comely youth quite a <unk> in his way i <unk> his <unk> by this i escaped the <unk> of the rest for be it known that though little inclined to jealousy in love matters the <unk> will hear of no <unk> in his friendship <unk> running over his <unk> as a friend first of all informed me that he was a <unk> thus declaring his <unk> with the church the way this <unk> of mine expressed his regard was by assuring me over and over again that the love he bore me was nuee nuee nuee or <unk> extensive all over these seas the word nuee is significant of quantity its repetition is like placing ciphers at the right hand of a <unk> the more places you carry it out to the greater the sum judge then of <unk> esteem nor is the allusion to the ciphers at all <unk> seeing that in themselves <unk> profession turned out to be worthless he was alas as sounding brass and a <unk> <unk> one of those who make no music unless the <unk> be silver in the course of a few days the sailors like the doctor and myself were <unk> out of everything and our <unk> all round began to cool off quite <unk> so <unk> did they become in their <unk> that we could no longer rely upon their bringing us the daily supply of food which all of them had faithfully promised as for <unk> after <unk> me well he one morning played the part of a <unk> lover <unk> me that his <unk> had undergone a change he had fallen in love at first sight with a smart sailor who had just stepped ashore quite flush from a lucky <unk> it was a touching interview and with it our connection <unk> but the sadness which ensued would soon have been <unk> had not my sensibilities been wounded by his <unk> sporting some of my gifts very soon after this <unk> of his <unk> hardly a day passed that i did not meet him on the <unk> road <unk> himself in a <unk> shirt which i had given him in happier hours he went by with such an easy <unk> too looking me pleasantly in the eye and merely exchanging the cold salute of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a mere <unk> how dye do after several experiences like this i began to entertain a sort of respect for <unk> as quite a man of the world in good sooth he turned out to be one in one weeks time giving me the cut direct and lounging by without even nodding he must have taken me for part of the landscape before the chests were quite empty we had a grand washing in the stream of our best raiment for the purpose of looking tidy and visiting the european chapel in the village every sunday morning it is open for divine service some member of the mission <unk> this was the first time we ever entered <unk> <unk> by an escort in the chapel there were about forty people present including the officers of several ships in harbour it was an energetic discourse and the pulpit <unk> was well pounded occupying a high seat in the <unk> and stiff as a <unk> was our beloved guardian <unk> i shall never forget his look of wonder when his interesting <unk> filed in at the <unk> and took up a seat directly facing him service over we waited outside in hopes of seeing more of him but sorely annoyed at the sight of us he <unk> from the window and never came forth until we had started for home chapter xli we <unk> <unk> on the shipping scarcely a week went by after the <unk> sailing when with the <unk> <unk> of sailors some of the men began to grow weary of the <unk> <unk> and resolved to go boldly among the vessels in the bay and offer to ship the thing was tried but though strongly recommended by the commodore of the <unk> in the end they were invariably told by the captains to whom they applied that they bore an equivocal character ashore and would not answer so often were they repulsed that we pretty nearly gave up all thoughts of leaving the island in this way and growing domestic again settled down quietly at captain <unk> it was about this time that the <unk> which have their regular seasons for cruising began to arrive at <unk> and of course their crews frequently visited us this is customary all over the pacific no sailor steps ashore but he straightway goes to the <unk> where he is almost sure to find some poor fellow or other in confinement for <unk> or alleged mutiny or something of that sort sympathy is <unk> and if need be tobacco the latter however is most in request as a solace to the captive it is invaluable having fairly carried the day against both <unk> and captain we were objects of even more than ordinary interest to these philanthropists and they always cordially <unk> our conduct besides they invariably brought along something in the way of <unk> occasionally smuggling in a little <unk> upon one occasion when there was quite a number present a calabash was passed round and a pecuniary collection taken up for our benefit one day a <unk> proposed that two or three of us should pay him a sly <unk> visit aboard his ship engaging to send us away well freighted with provisions this was not a bad idea nor were we at all backward in acting upon it right after night every vessel in the harbour was visited in rotation the <unk> <unk> captain <unk> canoe for the purpose as we all took turns at <unk> by <unk> due course it came to long ghost and myself for the sailors invariably linked us together in such an enterprise i somewhat <unk> the doctor for he was no sailor and very tall and a canoe is the most <unk> of <unk> things however it could not be helped and so we went but a word about the canoes before we go any further among the society islands the art of building them like all native <unk> has greatly <unk> and they are now the most <unk> as well as the most <unk> of any in the south seas in cooks time according to his account there was at tahiti a royal fleet of <unk> hundred and twenty large war canoes <unk> carved and otherwise adorned at present those used are quite small nothing more than logs <unk> out <unk> at one end and then launched into the water to <unk> a certain rolling <unk> the <unk> like all polynesians <unk> to them what sailors call an <unk> it consists of a pole floating alongside parallel to the canoe and connected with it by a couple of cross sticks a yard or more in length thus <unk> the canoe cannot be overturned unless you overcome the <unk> of the pole or lift it entirely out of the water now captain <unk> <unk> was exceedingly small so small and of such a grotesque shape that the sailors <unk> it the <unk> box and by this appellation it always went in fact it was a sort of sulky meant for a solitary <unk> but on an <unk> capable of floating two or three the <unk> was a mere <unk> alternately rising in air and then <unk> in the water assuming the command of the expedition upon the strength of my being a sailor i packed the long doctor with a paddle in the bow and then <unk> off leaped into the stern thus leaving him to do all the work and <unk> to myself the dignified <unk> of steering all would have gone on well were it not that my <unk> made such clumsy work that the water <unk> and showered down upon us without <unk> continuing to ply his <unk> however quite <unk> i thought he would improve after a while and so let him alone but by and <unk> getting wet through with this little storm we were raising and seeing no signs of its clearing off i conjured him in <unk> name to stop short and let me <unk> myself out upon this he suddenly turned round when the canoe gave a roll the <unk> flew overhead and the next moment came rap on the doctors skull and we were both in the water fortunately we were just over a ledge of coral not <unk> under the surface <unk> one end of the filled canoe and letting go of it quickly it <unk> up and discharged a great part of its contents so that we easily <unk> out the remainder and again embarked this time my comrade coiled himself away in a very small space and <unk> upon him not to draw a single unnecessary breath i proceeded to urge the canoe along by myself i was astonished at his <unk> never speaking a word and stirring neither hand nor foot but the secret was he was unable to swim and in case we met with a second <unk> there were no more ledges beneath to stand upon <unk> but a shabby way of going out of the world he exclaimed upon my rallying him and im not going to be guilty of it at last the ship was at hand and we approached with much caution <unk> to avoid being hailed by <unk> from the quarterdeck dropping silently under her bows we heard a low <unk> signal agreed <unk> presently a <unk> bag was lowered over to us we cut the line and then paddled away as fast as we could and made the best of our way home here we found the rest waiting impatiently the bag turned out to be well filled with sweet potatoes boiled <unk> of salt beef and pork and a famous sailors pudding what they call duff made of <unk> and water and of about the <unk> of an <unk> brick with these <unk> and keen <unk> we went out into the moonlight and had a <unk> <unk> chapter xlii <unk> a <unk> <unk> the <unk> box was sometimes employed for other purposes than that described in the last chapter we sometimes went <unk> in it right in the middle of <unk> harbour is a bright green island one circular grove of waving palms and scarcely a hundred yards across it is of coral formation and all round for many rods out the bay is so shallow that you might <unk> anywhere down in these waters as transparent as air you see coral plants of every hue and shape <unk> tufts of azure waving <unk> like <unk> of grain and pale green buds and mosses in some places you look through <unk> branches down to a snowwhite floor of sand <unk> with <unk> <unk> and crawling among these are strange <unk> bristling with spikes others clad in shining coats of mail and here and there round forms all <unk> with eyes the island is called <unk> and around <unk> have i often paddled of a white moonlight night pausing now and then to admire the marine gardens beneath the place is the private property of the queen who has a residence <unk> <unk> range of bamboo <unk> and falling to decay among the trees commanding the harbour as it does her majesty has done all she could to make a fortress of the island the margin has been raised and levelled and built up with a low <unk> of <unk> <unk> of coral behind the <unk> are ranged at wide intervals a number of rusty old cannon of all <unk> and <unk> they are mounted upon lame <unk> <unk> ready to sink under the useless burden of bearing them up indeed two or three have given up the ghost altogether and the pieces they sustained lie half buried among their <unk> bones several of the cannon are spiked probably with a view of making them more <unk> as they certainly must be to <unk> undertaking to fire them off presented to <unk> at various times by captains of british armed ships these poor old dogs of war thus <unk> and turned out to die formerly <unk> in full pack as the <unk> of old england there was something about <unk> that struck my fancy and i <unk> a vow to plant my foot upon its soil notwithstanding an old bareheaded sentry menaced me in the moonlight with an <unk> musket as my canoe drew scarcely three inches of water i could paddle close up to the <unk> without <unk> but every time i came near the old man ran toward me pushing his piece forward but never clapping it to his shoulder thinking he only meant to frighten me i at last dashed the canoe right up to the wall <unk> a leap it was the <unk> act of my life for never did cocoanut come nearer getting <unk> than mine did then with the stock of his gun the old <unk> <unk> a tremendous blow which i managed to <unk> and then falling back succeeded in paddling out of <unk> reach he must have been dumb for never a word did he utter but grinning from ear to ear and with his white cotton robe streaming in the moonlight he looked more like the <unk> of the island than anything mortal i tried to effect my object by <unk> him in the <unk> he was all front running about the place as i paddled and presenting his confounded musket wherever i went at last i was obliged to retreat and to this day my vow remains <unk> it was a few days after my repulse from before the walls of <unk> that i heard a curious case of <unk> <unk> between one of the most <unk> and intelligent natives i ever saw in tahiti a man by the name of <unk> and our learned <unk> of a doctor it was <unk> it was right and lawful for <unk> being a native to keep the european <unk> in <unk> to the day set apart as such by the missionaries and so considered by the islanders in general it must be known that the missionaries of the good ship duff who more than <unk> ago established the <unk> reckoning came hither by the way of the cape of good hope and by thus sailing to the eastward lost one precious day of their lives all round getting about that much in advance of <unk> time for this reason vessels coming round cape <unk> they most all do <unk> it sunday in tahiti when according to their own view of the matter it ought to be saturday but as it wont do to <unk> the log the sailors keep their <unk> and the islanders theirs this confusion <unk> the poor natives <unk> and it is to no purpose that you endeavour to explain so incomprehensible a phenomenon i once saw a worthy old missionary essay to shed some light on the subject and though i understood but a few of the words employed i could easily get at the meaning of his <unk> they were something like the following here says he you see this circle describing a large one on the ground with a stick very good now you see this spot here marking a point in the <unk> well this is <unk> england and im going to sail round to tahiti here i go then following the circle round and there goes the sun snatching up another stick and <unk> a <unk> native to travel round with it in a contrary direction now then we are both off and both going away from each other and here you see i have arrived at tahiti making a sudden stop and look now where <unk> legs is but the crowd <unk> maintained that <unk> legs ought to be somewhere above them in the atmosphere for it was a <unk> fact that the people from the duff came ashore when the sun was high overhead and here the old gentleman being a very good sort of man doubtless but no <unk> was obliged to give up <unk> the <unk> alluded to though a member of the church and extremely conscientious about what <unk> he kept was more liberal in other matters learning that i was something of a <unk> in this sense a man able to read and cunning in the use of the pen he desired the slight favour of my <unk> for him a set of papers for which he said he would be much obliged and give me a good dinner of roast pig and indian <unk> in the <unk> now <unk> was one of those who board the shipping for their washing and the <unk> being very great the <unk> chiefs not <unk> to <unk> custom in person though the work is done by their <unk> he had decided upon a course suggested by a knowing sailor a friend of his he wished to have <unk> a set of <unk> <unk> to come from certain manofwar and merchant captains known to have visited the island <unk> him as one of the best <unk> up of fine linen in all polynesia at this time <unk> had known me but two hours and as he made the proposition very coolly i thought it rather <unk> and told him so but as it was quite impossible to convey a hint and there was a slight <unk> in the thing i did not <unk> the insult but simply declined chapter <unk> one is <unk> by the company he keeps although from its <unk> life at captain <unk> was pleasant enough for the time there were some few annoyances connected with it anything but agreeable to a soul of <unk> <unk> against us by the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and others many worthy foreigners ashore regarded us as a set of <unk> <unk> though truth to speak better <unk> sailors never stepped on the island nor any who gave less trouble to the natives but for all this whenever we met a <unk> european ten to one he shunned us by going over to the other side of the road this was very unpleasant at least to myself though <unk> it did not prey upon the minds of the others to give an instance of a fine evening in <unk> they are all fine <unk> <unk> may see a <unk> of silk <unk> and <unk> passing along the <unk> road perhaps a band of pale little white <unk> <unk> oftener still sedate elderly gentlemen with canes at whose appearance the natives here and there <unk> into their <unk> these are the missionaries their wives and children taking a family <unk> sometimes by the <unk> they take horse and ride down to point <unk> and back a distance of several miles at this place is settled the only survivor of the first missionaries that <unk> old <unk> <unk> man by the name of <unk> the father of our friend the <unk> the little parties on foot were frequently encountered and recalling as they did so many pleasant <unk> of home and the ladies i really longed for a dress coat and beaver that i might step up and pay my respects but situated as i was this was out of the question on one occasion however i received a kind <unk> glance from a <unk> in <unk> sweet lady i have not forgotten her her <unk> was a <unk> but a glance like hers was not always bestowed one evening passing the <unk> of a <unk> dwelling the dame his wife and a pretty <unk> young girl with <unk> were sitting there enjoying the <unk> then coming in all cool and refreshing from the spray of the reef as i approached the old lady peered hard at me and her very cap seemed to convey a <unk> <unk> the blue english eyes by her side were also bent on me but oh heavens what a glance to receive from such a beautiful creature as for the mob cap not a <unk> did i care for it but to be taken for anything but a <unk> by the <unk> one was absolutely unendurable i resolved on a courteous salute to show my <unk> if nothing more but happening to wear a sort of <unk> to be particularly alluded <unk> was no taking it off and putting it on again with anything like dignity at any rate then here goes a how but another difficulty presented itself my loose frock was so <unk> that i doubted whether any spinal <unk> would be perceptible good evening ladies exclaimed i at last advancing <unk> a delightful air from the sea ladies <unk> and <unk> who would have thought it the young lady <unk> and the old one came near fainting as for myself i retreated in <unk> time and scarcely drew breath until safely housed in the <unk> chapter <unk> cathedral of <unk> church of the cocoanuts on <unk> i always attended the principal native church on the <unk> of the village of <unk> and not far from the <unk> <unk> it was esteemed the best specimen of <unk> in tahiti of late they have built their places of worship with more reference to <unk> than formerly at one time there were no less than <unk> on the <unk> <unk> tied together with <unk> which went to destruction in a very few years one built many years ago in this style was a most remarkable structure it was erected by <unk> ii who on this occasion showed all the zeal of a royal <unk> the building was over seven hundred feet in length and of a <unk> width the vast ridgepole was at intervals supported by a row of <unk> <unk> trunks of the breadfruit tree and all round the <unk> rested on <unk> of the palm the <unk> <unk> to within a mans height of the <unk> thatched with leaves and the sides of the edifice were open thus spacious was the royal mission chapel of <unk> at its <unk> three distinct <unk> were from different <unk> <unk> to an immense <unk> gathered from all parts of the island as the chapel was built by the kings command nearly as great a multitude was employed in its construction as <unk> over the <unk> of the great temple of the <unk> much less time however was expended in less than three weeks from planting the first post the last tier of <unk> drooped from the eaves and the work was done <unk> to the several chiefs and their <unk> the <unk> though immense was greatly <unk> by <unk> bringing his post or his <unk> or his pole strung with <unk> ready for instant use the materials thus prepared being afterwards secured together by <unk> there was literally neither hammer nor axe nor any <unk> of iron heard in the house while it was building but the most singular circumstance connected with this south sea cathedral remains to be related as well for the beauty as the <unk> of such a site the islanders love to dwell near the mountain streams and so a considerable brook after descending from the hills and <unk> the valley was <unk> over in three places and swept clean through the chapel flowing waters what an <unk> to the songs of the <unk> mingling with them the <unk> and <unk> of the green solitudes inland but the chapel of the polynesian solomon has long since been deserted its thousand rafters of <unk> have decayed and fallen to the ground and now the stream <unk> over them in its bed the present <unk> church of tahiti is very unlike the one just described it is of moderate dimensions boarded over and painted white it is furnished also with blinds but no <unk> indeed were it not for the rustic thatch it would remind one of a plain chapel at home the <unk> was all done by foreign carpenters of whom there are always several about <unk> within its aspect is <unk> and cannot fail to interest a stranger the rafters overhead are bound round with fine <unk> of variegated <unk> and all along the ridgepole these <unk> hang <unk> in <unk> bunches of tassels and deep <unk> of stained grass the floor is composed of rude planks regular <unk> run between ranges of native <unk> <unk> with crossed <unk> of the cocoanut <unk> and furnished with backs but the pulpit made of a dark lustrous wood and standing at one end is by far the most striking object it is <unk> lofty indeed a capital <unk> view of the congregation ought to be had from its summit nor does the church lack a gallery which runs round on three sides and is supported by columns of the cocoanut tree its <unk> are here and there <unk> over with a <unk> blue and in other places without the slightest regard to <unk> patches of the same colour may be seen in their <unk> to <unk> the <unk> the <unk> must have borrowed each a brush full of paint and <unk> <unk> away at the first surface that offered as hinted the general impression is extremely curious little light being admitted and everything being of a dark colour there is an <unk> indian aspect of <unk> throughout a strange <unk> smell <unk> or less pervading every considerable edifice in <unk> at once perceptible it <unk> the idea of <unk> idols packed away in some old <unk> at hand for the most part the congregation attending this church is composed of the better and <unk> <unk> chiefs and their <unk> in short the rank and fashion of the island this class is infinitely superior in personal beauty and general <unk> to the <unk> or common people the latter having been more exposed to the worst and most <unk> evils of foreign intercourse on <unk> the former are invariably arrayed in their <unk> and thus appear to the best advantage nor are they driven to the chapel as some of their <unk> are to other places of worship on the contrary capable of maintaining a handsome exterior and possessing greater intelligence they go voluntarily in respect of the woodland <unk> supporting its galleries i called this chapel the church of the cocoanuts it was the first place for christian worship in polynesia that i had seen and the impression upon entering during service was all the stronger <unk> chiefs whose fathers had hurled the <unk> and old men who had seen sacrifices smoking upon the altars of oro were there and hark hanging from the bough of a breadfruit tree without a bell is being struck with a bar of iron by a native lad in the same spot the blast of the <unk> had often resounded but to the proceedings within the place is well filled everywhere meets the eye the gay calico <unk> worn on great occasions by the higher classes and forming a strange contrast of <unk> and colours in some instances these are so fashioned as to resemble as much as possible european garments this is in <unk> bad taste coats and pantaloons too are here and there seen but they look <unk> enough and take away from the general effect but it is the array of countenances that most strikes you each is <unk> with the peculiar animation of the polynesians when thus collected in large numbers every robe is rustling every limb in motion and an incessant <unk> going on throughout the <unk> the tumult is so great that the voice of the placid old missionary who now rises is almost <unk> some degree of silence is at length obtained through the exertions of <unk> <unk> fellows in white shirts and no pantaloons running in among the <unk> they are at great pains to <unk> the <unk> of making a noise by creating a most unnecessary <unk> themselves this part of the service was quite comical there is a most interesting <unk> school connected with the church and the <unk> a vivacious mischievous set were in one part of the gallery i was <unk> by a party in a corner the teacher sat at one end of the bench with a meek little fellow by his side when the others were <unk> this young <unk> received a rap intended probably as a <unk> of what the rest might expect if they didnt <unk> standing in the body of the church and leaning against a pillar was an old man in appearance very different from others of his countrymen he wore nothing but a coarse <unk> mantle of faded tappa and from his staring bewildered manner i set him down as an aged <unk> from the interior <unk> to the strange sights and sounds of the metropolis this old worthy was sharply <unk> for standing up and thus <unk> the view of those behind but not <unk> exactly what was said to him one of the <unk> <unk> made no ceremony of grasping him by the shoulders and fairly <unk> him down into a seat during all this the old missionary in the <unk> well as his associates beneath never ventured to <unk> everything to native management with south sea islanders assembled in any numbers there is no other way of getting along chapter <unk> <unk> sermon with some reflections some degree of order at length restored the service was continued by singing the <unk> was composed of twelve or fifteen ladies of the mission occupying a long bench to the left of the pulpit almost the entire congregation joined in the first air fairly startled me it was the brave tune of old hundred adapted to a <unk> <unk> after the <unk> scenes i had recently passed through this circumstance with all its <unk> moved me forcibly many voices around were of great sweetness and compass the <unk> also seemed to enjoy themselves <unk> some of them pausing now and then and looking round as if to <unk> the scene more fully in truth they sang right <unk> despite the solemnity of the tune the <unk> have much natural <unk> for singing and on all occasions are exceedingly fond of it i have often heard a stave or two of <unk> hummed over by <unk> young fellows like a snatch from an <unk> with respect to singing as in most other matters the <unk> widely <unk> from the people of the sandwich islands where the <unk> flocks may be said rather to heat than sing the <unk> concluded a prayer followed very <unk> the good old missionary made it short for the congregation became <unk> and <unk> as soon as it commenced a chapter of the <unk> bible was now read a text selected and the sermon began it was listened to with more attention than i had anticipated having been informed from various sources that the <unk> of the missionaries being calculated to engage the attention of their simple auditors were naturally enough of a rather amusing description to strangers in short that they had much to say about <unk> lord <unk> <unk> and the way fires are put out in london i had taken care to provide myself with a good <unk> in the person of an intelligent hawaiian sailor whose acquaintance i had made now jack said i before entering hear every word and tell me what you can as the missionary goes on jacks was not perhaps a critical version of the discourse and at the time i took no notes of what he said nevertheless i will here venture to give what i remember of it and as far as possible in jacks <unk> so as to lose nothing by a double <unk> good friends i glad to see you and i very well like to have some talk with you today good friends very bad times in tahiti it make me weep <unk> is <unk> island no more yours but the <unk> french wicked priests here too and wicked idols in womans clothes and brass chains good friends no you speak or look at <unk> i know you <unk> belong to a set of <unk> wicked <unk> soon these bad men be made to go very quick <unk> ships of thunder come and away they go but no more bout this now i speak more by by good friends many whaleships here now and many bad men come in em no good sailors <unk> you know very well they come here cause so bad they no keep em home my good little girls no run after <unk> go where they go they harm you where they come from no good people talk to <unk> like dogs here they talk to <unk> and drink arva with great <unk> good friends this very small island but very wicked and very poor these two go together why <unk> so great because that island good island and send <unk> to poor <unk> in <unk> every man rich plenty things to buy and plenty things to sell houses <unk> than <unk> and more grand everybody too ride about in <unk> <unk> than hers and wear fine tappa every day several luxurious <unk> of civilization were here <unk> and described good friends little to eat left at my house schooner from <unk> no bring bag of <unk> and <unk> no bring pig and fruit enough <unk> do great deal for <unk> <unk> do little for <unk> so good friends <unk> plenty of cocoanut baskets fill em and bring em tomorrow such was the substance of great part of this discourse and whatever may be thought of it it was specially adapted to the minds of the islanders who are susceptible to no impressions except from things <unk> or novel and striking to them a dry sermon would be dry indeed the <unk> can hardly ever be said to reflect they are all impulse and so instead of <unk> <unk> the missionaries give them the large type pleasing cuts and short and easy <unk> of the <unk> hence anything like a permanent religious impression is seldom or never produced in fact there is perhaps no race upon earth less disposed by nature to the <unk> of christianity than the people of the south seas and this assertion is made with full knowledge of what is called the great <unk> at the sandwich islands about the year <unk> when several thousands were in the course of a few weeks admitted into the bosom of the church but this result was brought about by no sober moral convictions as an almost <unk> <unk> into every kind of <unk> soon after <unk> it was the legitimate effect of a morbid feeling <unk> by the sense of severe physical wants <unk> upon minds <unk> prone to superstition and by <unk> <unk> inflamed into the belief that the gods of the missionaries were taking vengeance upon the wickedness of the land it is a noteworthy fact that those very traits in the <unk> which induced the london missionary society to regard them as the most promising subjects for conversion and which led moreover to the <unk> of their island as the very first field for missionary <unk> eventually proved the most serious <unk> an air of <unk> in their manners great apparent <unk> and <unk> at first <unk> but these were the mere <unk> of an <unk> bodily and mental a constitutional <unk> and an <unk> to the least <unk> which however fitted for the luxurious state of nature in the tropics are the greatest possible <unk> to the strict <unk> of christianity added to all this is a quality <unk> in polynesians and more akin to <unk> than anything else it leads them to assume the most passionate interest in matters for which they really feel little or none whatever but in which those whose power they dread or whose favour they court they believe to be at all affected thus in their heathen state the sandwich islanders actually knocked out their teeth tore their hair and <unk> their bodies with shells to <unk> their <unk> grief at the <unk> of a high chief or member of the royal family and yet <unk> relates that on such an occasion upon which he happened to be present those apparently the most abandoned to their feelings immediately assumed the utmost <unk> on receiving the present of a penny whistle or a dutch <unk> similar instances also have come under my own observation the following is an illustration of the trait alluded to as occasionally manifested among the converted polynesians at one of the society <unk> i <unk> natives for special reasons desired to <unk> themselves particularly to the favour of the missionaries accordingly during divine service many of them <unk> in a manner otherwise unaccountable and precisely similar to their behaviour as heathens they pretended to be wrought up to madness by the <unk> which they heard they rolled their eyes <unk> at the mouth fell down in fits and so were carried home yet strange to relate all this was deemed the evidence of the power of the most high and as such was <unk> abroad but to return to the church of the cocoanuts the blessing pronounced the congregation <unk> <unk> the <unk> road with their waving <unk> on either hand they disappear down the shaded <unk> which lead off from the main route <unk> to <unk> in the groves or to the little marine <unk> upon the beach there is considerable hilarity and you would suppose them just from an oldfashioned <unk> or jolly heathen dance those who carry <unk> swing them carelessly from their arms by cords of <unk> the <unk> is no ordinary day with the <unk> so far as doing any work is concerned it is <unk> observed the canoes are hauled up on the beach the <unk> are spread to dry passing by the <unk> <unk> on the roadside you find their occupants idle as usual but less disposed to gossip after service repose <unk> over the whole island the valleys reaching inland look <unk> than ever in short it is <unk> taboo day the very word formerly expressing the <unk> of their pagan <unk> now <unk> the sanctity of the christian <unk> chapter <unk> something about the <unk> a worthy young man formerly a friend of mine i speak of <unk> with all possible courtesy since after our <unk> there would be an <unk> in doing <unk> worthy youth having some genteel notions of <unk> dwelt in a <unk> <unk> or breadfruit shade a pretty nook in a wood midway between the <unk> <unk> and the church of cocoanuts hence at the latter place he was one of the most regular <unk> <unk> was a blade standing up in the congregation in all the bravery of a <unk> calico shirt with the skirts <unk> <unk> over a pair of white sailor <unk> and hair well <unk> with cocoanut oil he <unk> the ladies with an air of supreme satisfaction nor were his glances <unk> but such looks as the <unk> <unk> cast at each other frequently turning up their noses at the advent of a new cotton mantle recently <unk> in the chest of some <unk> sailor upon one occasion i observed a group of young girls in <unk> of course soiled <unk> <unk> pointing at a damsel in a flaming red one <unk> <unk> <unk> said they with ineffable scorn <unk> <unk> you are a <unk> <unk> no better than you should be now <unk> <unk> with the church so did all these <unk> young ladies yet after eating breadfruit at the <unk> i knew several of them the same night to be guilty of some sad <unk> puzzled by these things i resolved to find out if possible what ideas if any they entertained of religion but as ones spiritual concerns are rather delicate for a stranger to <unk> with i went to work as <unk> as i could <unk> an old native who had recently retired from active pursuits having thrown up the business of being a sort of running <unk> to the queen had settled down in a snug little retreat not fifty rods from captain <unk> his selecting our vicinity for his residence may have been with some view to the <unk> it afforded for <unk> his three daughters into polite circles at any rate not averse to receiving the <unk> of so devoted a gallant as the doctor the sisters <unk> be it remembered kindly extended to him free permission to visit them sociably whenever he pleased we dropped in one evening and found the ladies at home my long friend engaged his <unk> the two younger girls at the game of now or hunting a stone under three piles of tappa for myself i lounged on a mat with <unk> the <unk> <unk> with her grass fan and improving my knowledge of <unk> the occasion was well adapted to my purpose and i began ah <unk> <unk> <unk> the same as <unk> <unk> the <unk> miss <unk> do you belong to the church yes me <unk> was the reply but the assertion was at once qualified by certain <unk> so curious that i cannot forbear their relation <unk> <unk> church member here exclaimed she laying her hand upon her mouth and a strong <unk> on the <unk> in the same way and with similar exclamations she touched her eyes and hands this done her whole air changed in an instant and she gave me to understand by <unk> gestures that in certain other respects she was not exactly a <unk> in short <unk> was a sad good christian at the <unk> very heathen in the <unk> part the explanation terminated in a burst of laughter in which all three sisters joined and for fear of looking silly the doctor and myself as soon as <unk> would permit we took leave the <unk> in matters of religion so apparent in all polynesian <unk> is most <unk> nourished in tahiti by a <unk> and in many cases a <unk> <unk> over their spiritual <unk> but it is only manifested with respect to the common people their superiors being exempted on sunday mornings when the prospect is rather small for a full house in the minor churches a parcel of fellows are actually sent out with <unk> into the <unk> and <unk> as <unk> of the congregation this is a sober fact these worthies <unk> a religious police and you always know them by the great white <unk> they wear on week days they are quite as busy as on <unk> to the great terror of the inhabitants going all over the island and spying out the wickedness thereof moreover they are the <unk> of <unk> generally in grass <unk> <unk> <unk> upon divine worship and other offences <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of the missionaries old <unk> called these fellows <unk> a <unk> i fancy of our word <unk> he bore them a bitter grudge and one day drawing near home and learning that two of them were just then making a <unk> visit at his house he ran behind a bush and as they came forth two green breadfruit from a hand unseen took them each between the shoulders the sailors in the <unk> were witnesses to this as well as several natives who when the <unk> were out of sight <unk> captain <unk> spirit in no measured terms the ladies present <unk> joining in indeed the <unk> have no greater enemies than the latter and no wonder the <unk> varlets <unk> into their houses at all hours are forever prying into their <unk> <unk> who at times was patriotic and pensive and mourned the evils under which his country was <unk> frequently <unk> against the statute which thus <unk> an utter stranger to interfere with domestic arrangements he <unk> a ladies <unk> often been annoyed thereby he considered the <unk> a bore beside their confounded <unk> they add insult to injury by making a point of dining out every day at some hut within the limits of their <unk> as for the gentleman of the house his meek <unk> of these things is amazing but good easy man there is nothing for him but to be as hospitable as possible these <unk> are indefatigable at the dead of night prowling round the houses and in the <unk> hunting <unk> <unk> in the groves yet in one instance the chase completely baffled them it was thus several weeks previous to our arrival at the island <unk> husband and another persons wife having taken a mutual fancy for each other went out for a walk the alarm was raised and with hue and cry they were pursued but nothing was seen of them again until the lapse of some ninety days when we were called out from the <unk> to behold a great mob <unk> the lovers and <unk> them for trial to the village their appearance was most singular the girdle <unk> they were quite naked their hair was long burned yellow at the ends and entangled with <unk> and their bodies <unk> and scarred in all directions it seems that acting upon the love in a cottage principle they had gone right into the interior and throwing up a hut in an uninhabited valley had lived there until in an <unk> stroll they were observed and captured they were subsequently condemned to make one hundred fathoms of <unk> <unk> six months work if not more often when seated in a house conversing quietly with its inmates i have known them betray the greatest confusion at the sudden announcement of a <unk> being in sight to be reported by one of these <unk> as a <unk> <unk> in general <unk> a bad person or <unk> in christianity is as much dreaded as the forefinger of <unk> <unk> was levelled at an alleged <unk> but the islanders take a sly revenge upon them upon entering a dwelling the <unk> oftentimes <unk> a <unk> <unk> hence they go in secret by the name of <unk> literally <unk> chapter <unk> how they dress in tahiti except where the employment of making tappa is inflicted as a punishment the echoes of the <unk> have long since died away in the <unk> valleys of tahiti formerly the girls spent their mornings like ladies at their <unk> <unk> now they are lounged away in almost utter <unk> true most of them make their own garments but this <unk> but a stitch or two the ladies of the mission by the <unk> being entitled to the credit of <unk> them to <unk> the <unk> <unk> or <unk> is a mere breadth of white cotton or calico loosely enveloping the person from the waist to the feet fastened simply by a single <unk> or by twisting the upper corners together this garment frequently becomes disordered thus affording an opportunity of being <unk> <unk> over the <unk> they wear a sort of <unk> open in front very loose and as <unk> as you please the ladies here never dress for dinner but what shall be said of those horrid hats fancy a bunch of straw plaited into the shape of a <unk> and stuck bolt upright on the crown with a yard or two of red ribbon flying about like <unk> <unk> of paris what would ye say to them though made by the natives they are said to have been first contrived and recommended by the missionaries wives a report which i really trust is nothing but <unk> curious to relate these things for the head are esteemed exceedingly becoming the <unk> of the straw is one of the few employments of the higher classes all of which but minister to the <unk> vanity the young girls however wholly <unk> the hats leaving those <unk> old souls their mothers to make <unk> of themselves as for the men those who <unk> to european garments seem to have no <unk> of the relation <unk> between the various parts of a gentlemans costume to the <unk> of a coat for instance pantaloons are by no means indispensable and a <unk> hat and a girdle are full dress the young sailor for whom <unk> deserted me presented him with a shaggy old <unk> and with this buttoned up to his chin under a tropical sun he <unk> the <unk> road quite elated doctor long ghost who saw him thus ran away with the idea that he was under <unk> treatment at the <unk> the act of taking what the <unk> call a sweat a bachelor friend of captain <unk> rejoiced in the possession of a full european suit in which he often stormed the ladies hearts having a military leaning he <unk> the coat with a great <unk> patch on the breast and mounted it also here and there with several <unk> buttons slyly cut from the uniform of a parcel of <unk> marines sent ashore on a holiday from a manofwar but in spite of the ornaments the dress was not exactly the thing from the <unk> of the cloth across the shoulders his elbows projected from his sides like an <unk> <unk> and his ponderous legs were jammed so hard into his slim <unk> garments that the threads of every <unk> showed and at every step you looked for a catastrophe in general there seems to be no settled style of <unk> among the <unk> they wear anything they can get in some cases <unk> <unk> the <unk> of their fathers so as to <unk> with their own altered views of what is becoming but ridiculous as many of them now appear in foreign <unk> the <unk> presented a far different appearance in the original national costume which was graceful in the extreme modest to all but the <unk> and peculiarly adapted to the climate but the short <unk> of dyed tappa the <unk> <unk> and other articles formerly worn are at the present day prohibited by law as <unk> for what reason <unk> and garlands of flowers among the women are also forbidden i never could learn but it is said that they were <unk> in some way with a forgotten heathen <unk> many pleasant and seemingly innocent <unk> and <unk> are likewise <unk> in old times there were several <unk> games practised such as <unk> <unk> throwing the javelin and <unk> in all these they greatly <unk> and for some splendid <unk> were <unk> among their <unk> <unk> were dancing tossing the <unk> <unk> <unk> and singing <unk> <unk> now all <unk> offences though most of them have been so long in <unk> that they are nearly forgotten in the same way the <unk> or <unk> <unk> of the breadfruit has been suppressed though as described to me by captain <unk> it seemed wholly free from any <unk> tendency against tattooing of any kind there is a severe law that this <unk> of their national <unk> and customs was not willingly acquiesced in is shown in the frequent violation of many of the <unk> <unk> them and especially in the <unk> with which their <unk> or <unk> are practised in secret doubtless in thus <unk> the <unk> as it were the missionaries were prompted by a sincere desire for good but the effect has been <unk> supplied with no <unk> in place of those forbidden the <unk> who require more <unk> than other people have sunk into a <unk> or indulge in <unk> a hundred times more <unk> than all the games ever celebrated in the temple of <unk> chapter <unk> tahiti as it is as in the last few chapters several matters connected with the general condition of the natives have been incidentally touched upon it may be well not to leave so important a subject in a state calculated to convey <unk> impressions let us bestow upon it therefore something more than a mere <unk> glance but in the first place let it be distinctly understood that in all i have to say upon this subject both here and elsewhere i mean no harm to the missionaries nor their cause i merely desire to set forth things as they actually exist of the results which have flowed from the intercourse of foreigners with the polynesians including the attempts to <unk> and <unk> them by the missionaries tahiti on many accounts is obviously the <unk> practical example indeed it may now be asserted that the experiment of <unk> the <unk> and improving their social condition by the introduction of foreign customs has been fully tried the present generation have grown up under the <unk> of their religious <unk> and although it may be urged that the labours of the latter have at times been more or less <unk> by unprincipled foreigners still this in no wise renders tahiti any the less a fair illustration for with obstacles like these the missionaries in polynesia must always and everywhere struggle nearly sixty years have elapsed since the <unk> mission was started and during this period it has received the <unk> prayers and <unk> of its friends abroad nor has any enterprise of the kind called forth more devotion on the part of those directly employed in it it matters not that the earlier <unk> in the work although strictly conscientious were as a class ignorant and in many cases <unk> <unk> such traits have in some degree <unk> the <unk> of all <unk> and although in zeal and <unk> the missionaries now on the island are perhaps inferior to their <unk> they have nevertheless in their own way at least <unk> hard to make a christian people of their charge let us now glance at the most obvious <unk> wrought in their condition the entire system of <unk> has been done away together with several barbarous practices <unk> thereon but this result is not so much to be ascribed to the missionaries as to the <unk> effects of a long and constant intercourse with whites of all nations to whom for many years tahiti has been one of the principal places of resort in the south seas at the sandwich islands the potent <unk> of the taboo together with the entire <unk> of the land was utterly <unk> by a voluntary act of the natives some time previous to the arrival of the first missionaries among them the next most striking change in the <unk> is this from the permanent residence among them of <unk> and respectable foreigners as well as from the frequent visits of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the island its inhabitants are no longer deemed fit subjects for the <unk> practised upon mere savages and hence secure from <unk> vessels of all kinds now enter their <unk> with perfect safety but let us consider what results are directly <unk> to the missionaries alone in all cases they have <unk> hard to <unk> the evils resulting from the commerce with the whites in general such attempts however have been rather <unk> and often <unk> in truth a barrier almost <unk> is presented in the <unk> of the people themselves still in this respect the <unk> of the islanders is upon the whole improved by the presence of the missionaries but the greatest <unk> of the latter and one which in itself is most hopeful and <unk> is that they have translated the entire bible into the language of the island and i have myself known several who were able to read it with facility they have also established churches and schools for both children and <unk> the latter i regret to say are now much neglected which must be ascribed in a great measure to the <unk> growing out of the proceedings of the french it were unnecessary here to enter <unk> into matters connected with the internal government of the <unk> churches and schools nor upon this head is my information <unk> enough to warrant me in presenting details but we do not need them we are merely considering general results as made apparent in the moral and religious condition of the island at large upon a subject like this however it would be altogether too assuming for a single individual to decide and so in place of my own random observations which may be found elsewhere i will here present those of several known authors made under various circumstances at different periods and down to a comparative late <unk> a few very brief extracts will enable the reader to mark for himself what <unk> improvement if any has taken place nor must it be overlooked that of these authorities the two first in order are largely quoted by the right reverend <unk> <unk> in a work composed for the express purpose of <unk> information on the subject of christian <unk> in polynesia and he frankly <unk> moreover that they are such as cannot fail to have great weight with the public after <unk> to the manifold evils <unk> upon the natives by foreigners and their singularly inert condition and after somewhat too severely denouncing the undeniable errors of the mission <unk> the russian navigator says a religion like this which <unk> every innocent pleasure and <unk> or <unk> every mental power is a <unk> on the divine founder of christianity it is true that the religion of the missionaries has with a great deal of evil effected some good it has restrained the vices of theft and <unk> but it has given birth to ignorance <unk> and a hatred of all other modes of faith which was once foreign to the open and benevolent character of the <unk> captain <unk> says that while at tahiti he saw scenes which must have convinced the great <unk> of the thoroughly <unk> condition of the people and which would force him to conclude as <unk> did many years previous that their intercourse with the europeans had tended to <unk> rather than <unk> their condition about the year <unk> daniel <unk> an <unk> quaker prompted by motives of the <unk> <unk> visited in a vessel of his own most of the missionary settlements in the south seas he remained some time at tahiti receiving the <unk> of the missionaries there and from time to time <unk> the natives after <unk> their social condition he frankly says of their religious state certainly appearances are <unk> and however unwilling to adopt such a conclusion there is reason to <unk> that christian principle is a great <unk> such then is the testimony of good and <unk> men who have been upon the spot but how comes it to <unk> so widely from impressions of others at home simply thus instead of <unk> the result of missionary labours by the number of heathens who have actually been made to understand and <unk> in some measure at least the precepts of christianity this result has been <unk> inferred from the number of those who without any understanding of these things have in any way been induced to abandon <unk> and <unk> to certain outward <unk> by authority of some kind or other <unk> upon the natives through their chiefs and prompted by the hope of some worldly benefit to the latter and not by <unk> to the reason have <unk> in polynesia been in most cases brought about even in one or two <unk> often held up as wonderful examples of divine <unk> the natives have <unk> burned their idols and rushed to the waters of <unk> the very <unk> of the change has but indicated its <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> relates an instance where the inhabitants of an island <unk> christianity voluntarily assembled and solemnly revived all their heathen customs all the world over facts are more eloquent than words the following will show in what estimation the missionaries themselves hold the present state of christianity and <unk> among the converted polynesians on the island of <unk> attached to the <unk> mission is a <unk> under the charge of the <unk> mr <unk> and wife for the education of the children of the missionaries <unk> sent <unk> many cases at a very early <unk> <unk> their education the pupils here are taught nothing but the <unk> of knowledge nothing more than may be learned in the native schools notwithstanding this the two races are kept as far as possible from <unk> the <unk> reason being to preserve the young whites from moral <unk> the better to insure this end every effort is made to prevent them from <unk> the native language they went even further at the sandwich islands where a few years ago a <unk> for the children of the missionaries was inclosed with a fence many feet high the more effectually to <unk> the wicked little <unk> and yet strange as it may seem the <unk> among the polynesians which renders precautions like these necessary was in a measure unknown before their intercourse with the whites the excellent captain <unk> who took the first missionaries out to tahiti <unk> that the people of that island had in many things more refined ideas of <unk> than ourselves <unk> also has some noteworthy ideas on this subject respecting the sandwich islanders that the <unk> alluded to is continually increasing is plainly shown in the numerous severe and perpetually violated laws against <unk> of all kinds in both groups of islands it is hardly to be expected that the missionaries would send home accounts of this state of things hence captain <unk> in <unk> to the polynesian researches of <unk> says that the author has impressed his readers with a far more elevated idea of the moral condition of the <unk> and the degree of civilization to which they have attained than they <unk> or at least than the facts which came under his observation <unk> he then goes on to say that in his intercourse with the islanders they had no fear of him and consequently acted from the impulse of their natural feeling so that he was the better enabled to obtain a correct knowledge of their real disposition and habits <unk> my own familiar intercourse with the natives this last reflection still more forcibly applies to myself chapter <unk> same subject continued we have glanced at their moral and religious condition let us see how it is with them socially and in other respects it has been said that the only way to <unk> a people is to form in them habits of industry <unk> by this principle the <unk> are less civilized now than formerly true their constitutional <unk> is excessive but surely if the spirit of christianity is among them so <unk> a vice ought to be at least partially <unk> but the reverse is the fact instead of <unk> new <unk> old ones have been <unk> as previously remarked the manufacture of tappa is nearly obsolete in many parts of the island so too with that of the native tools and domestic <unk> very few of which are now <unk> since the superiority of european <unk> has been made so evident this however would be all very well were the natives to apply themselves to such <unk> as would enable them to supply the few articles they need but they are far from doing so and the majority being unable to obtain european <unk> for many things before made by themselves the inevitable consequence is seen in the present wretched and destitute mode of life among the common people to me so recently from a primitive valley of the marquesas the aspect of most of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and their general habits seemed anything but tidy nor could i avoid a comparison <unk> to the <unk> of these partially civilized islanders in tahiti the people have nothing to do and <unk> everywhere is the parent of vice there is scarcely anything says the good old quaker <unk> so striking or pitiable as their <unk> <unk> mode of spending life attempts have repeatedly been made to rouse them from their <unk> but in vain several years ago the <unk> of cotton was introduced and with their usual love of <unk> they went to work with great alacrity but the interest excited quickly subsided and now not a pound of the article is raised about the same time <unk> for weaving was sent out from london and a <unk> was started at <unk> in <unk> the <unk> of the wheels and <unk> brought in <unk> from all quarters who deemed it a privilege to be admitted to work yet in six months not a boy could be hired and the <unk> was knocked down and packed off to <unk> it was the same way with the <unk> of the <unk> a plant <unk> to the island peculiarly fitted to the soil and climate and of so excellent a quality that <unk> took <unk> of it to the west <unk> all the plantations went on <unk> for a while the natives swarming in the fields like <unk> and making a prodigious stir what few plantations now remain are owned and worked by whites who would rather pay a <unk> sailor eighteen or twenty spanish dollars a month than <unk> a sober native for his fish and <unk> it is well worthy remark here that every evidence of civilization among the south sea islands directly <unk> to foreigners though the fact of such evidence <unk> at all is usually urged as a proof of the elevated condition of the natives thus at <unk> the capital of the sandwich islands there are fine <unk> several <unk> and <unk> ay even <unk> but all these are owned and used be it observed by whites there are tailors and blacksmiths and carpenters also but not one of them is a native the fact is that the mechanical and <unk> employment of civilized life require a kind of exertion altogether too steady and sustained to agree with an indolent people like the polynesians calculated for a state of nature in a climate <unk> adapted to it they are <unk> for any other nay as a race they cannot otherwise long exist the following statement speaks for itself about the year <unk> captain cook <unk> the population of tahiti at about two hundred thousand by a regular census taken some four or five years ago it was found to be only nine thousand this amazing <unk> not only shows the <unk> of the evils necessary to produce it but from the fact the inference unavoidably follows that all the wars child <unk> and other <unk> causes alleged to have existed in former times were nothing in comparison to them these evils of course are solely of foreign origin to say nothing of the effects of drunkenness the occasional <unk> of the <unk> and other things which might be mentioned it is sufficient to allude to a <unk> disease which now <unk> the blood of at least <unk> of the common people of the island and in some form or other is <unk> from father to son their first horror and consternation at the earlier <unk> of this scourge were pitiable in the extreme the very name bestowed upon it is a <unk> of all that is horrid and <unk> to a civilized being distracted with their sufferings they brought forth their sick before the missionaries when they were <unk> and cried out lies lies you tell us of salvation and behold we are dying we want no other salvation than to live in this world where are there any saved through your speech <unk> is dead and we are all dying with your cursed <unk> when will you give over at present the <unk> of the disorder in individual cases has somewhat abated but the poison is only the more widely diffused how dreadful and appalling breaks forth old <unk> the consideration that the intercourse of distant nations should have <unk> upon these poor <unk> islanders a curse unprecedented and unheard of in the <unk> of history in view of these things who can remain blind to the fact that so far as mere temporal felicity is concerned the <unk> are far worse off now than formerly and although their circumstances upon the whole are <unk> by the presence of the missionaries the <unk> conferred by the latter become utterly insignificant when <unk> with the vast <unk> of evil brought about by other means their prospects are hopeless nor can the most devoted efforts now exempt them from furnishing a marked illustration of a principle which history has always <unk> years ago brought to a stand where all that is corrupt in <unk> and civilization unite to the <unk> of the virtues of either state like other uncivilized beings brought into contact with europeans they must here remain stationary until utterly extinct the islanders themselves are mournfully watching their doom several years since <unk> ii said to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the london missionary society you have come to see me at a very bad time your ancestors came in the time of men when tahiti was inhabited you are come to behold just the remnant of my people of like import was the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> who lived over a hundred years ago i have frequently heard it <unk> in a low sad tone by aged <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a now <unk> <unk> the <unk> shall grow the coral shall spread but man shall cease chapter <unk> something happens to long ghost we will now return to the narrative the day before the <unk> sailed dr johnson paid his last call he was not quite so bland as usual all he wanted was the mens names to a paper <unk> to their having received from him sundry <unk> therein mentioned this <unk> <unk> by captain <unk> secured his pay but he would not have obtained for it the sailors signs <unk> had either the doctor or myself been present at the time now my long friend wasted no love upon johnson but for reasons of his own hated him heartily all the same thing in one sense for either passion <unk> an object <unk> thereof and so to be hated cordially is only a <unk> compliment which shows how foolish it is to be bitter against <unk> for my own part i merely felt a cool purely incidental and passive contempt for johnson as a <unk> <unk> <unk> and hence i often <unk> with long ghost when he flew out against him and heaped upon him all manner of <unk> <unk> in his professional brothers presence however he never acted thus maintaining an amiable exterior to help along the jokes which were played i am now going to tell another story in which my long friend figures with the physician i do not wish to bring one or the other of them too often upon the stage but as the thing actually happened i must relate it a few days after johnson presented his bill as above mentioned the doctor expressed to me his regret that although he johnson had apparently been played off for our entertainment yet nevertheless he had made money out of the <unk> and i wonder added the doctor if that now he cannot expect to receive any further pay he could be induced to call again by a curious <unk> not five minutes after making this observation doctor long ghost himself fell down in an unaccountable fit and without asking <unk> leave captain <unk> who was by at once dispatched a boy hot foot for johnson meanwhile we carried him into the <unk> and the natives who assembled in numbers suggested various modes of treatment one rather energetic <unk> was for holding the patient by the shoulders while somebody <unk> at his feet this <unk> operation was called the <unk> but thinking our long comrade sufficiently lengthy without additional stretching we declined <unk> him presently the physician was spied coming along the <unk> road at a great rate and so absorbed in the business of <unk> that he heeded not the <unk> of being in a hurry in a tropical climate he was in a profuse perspiration which must have been owing to the warmth of his feelings notwithstanding we had supposed him a man of no heart but his benevolent haste upon this occasion was subsequently accounted for it merely arose from professional curiosity to behold a case most unusual in his polynesian practice now under certain circumstances sailors generally so <unk> are exceedingly particular in having everything conducted with the <unk> propriety accordingly they <unk> me as his intimate friend to sit at long ghosts head so as to be ready to <unk> as <unk> and answer all questions <unk> the rest to keep silent whats the matter exclaimed johnson out of breath and bursting into the <unk> how did it <unk> quick and he looked at long ghost i told him how the fit came on <unk> <unk> good enough pulse and he let go of it and placed his hand upon the heart but whats all that <unk> at the mouth he continued and bless me look at the abdomen the region thus denominated exhibited the most unaccountable symptoms a low <unk> sound was heard and a sort of <unk> was discernible beneath the thin cotton frock <unk> sir suggested a <unk> <unk> be <unk> shouted the physician who ever heard of anybody in a trance of the <unk> during this the patient lay upon his back stark and straight giving no signs of life except those above mentioned ill <unk> him cried johnson at <unk> for a calabash one of you life ho here sung out navy <unk> as if he had just spied a sail what under the suns the matter with him cried the physician starting at the appearance of the mouth which had <unk> to one side and there remained fixed <unk> its st <unk> <unk> suggested <unk> hold the <unk> the <unk> was out in a moment but before the deed could be done the face became <unk> sigh was <unk> <unk> <unk> opened closed and long ghost twitching all over rolled on his side and breathed <unk> by degrees he became sufficiently recovered to speak after trying to get something <unk> out of him johnson withdrew evidently disappointed in the scientific interest of the case soon after his departure the doctor sat up and upon being asked what upon earth <unk> him shook his head mysteriously he then <unk> the hardship of being an invalid in such a place where there was not the slightest <unk> for his comfort this awakened the <unk> of our good old <unk> who offered to send him to a place where he would be better cared for long ghost acquiesced and being at once mounted upon the shoulders of four of captain <unk> men was marched off in state like the grand <unk> of <unk> now i do not pretend to account for his remarkable <unk> but his reason for suffering himself to be thus removed from the <unk> was strongly suspected to be nothing more than a desire to insure more regularity in his <unk> hoping that the benevolent native to whom he was going would set a good table the next morning we were all <unk> his fortune when of a sudden he bolted in upon us looking <unk> out of humour hang it he cried im worse off than ever let me have some breakfast we lowered our slender bag of <unk> from a <unk> and handed him a biscuit while this was being <unk> he went on and told us his story after leaving here they <unk> me back into a valley and left me in a hut where an old woman lived by herself this must be the nurse thought i and so i asked her to kill a pig and <unk> it for i felt my appetite returning ha <unk> <unk> <unk> no you too sick the devil <unk> ye said <unk> me something to eat but nothing could be had night coming on i had to stay creeping into a corner i tried to sleep but it was to no <unk> old <unk> must have had the <unk> or something else and she kept up such a <unk> and <unk> that at last i sprang up and groped after her but she hobbled away like a <unk> and that was the last of her as soon as the sun rose i made the best of my way back and here i am he never left us more nor ever had a second fit chapter <unk> <unk> gives us the <unk> for <unk> about three weeks after the <unk> sailing our <unk> began to be a little <unk> we were without any regular supply of food the arrival of ships was growing less frequent and what was worse yet all the natives but good old captain <unk> began to <unk> of us nor was this to be wondered at we were obliged to live upon their benevolence when they had little enough for themselves besides we were sometimes driven to acts of <unk> such as <unk> <unk> and cooking them in the groves at which their <unk> were by no means pleased in this state of affairs we determined to march off to the <unk> in a body and as he had brought us to these straits demand an adequate <unk> on the point of starting captain <unk> men raised the most outrageous cries and tried to prevent us though hitherto we had strolled about wherever we pleased this grand <unk> of our whole force upon one particular expedition seemed to alarm them but we assured them that we were not going to assault the village and so after a good deal of gibberish they permitted us to leave we went straight to the <unk> residence where the <unk> dwelt this <unk> which i have before <unk> quite <unk> it has a wide <unk> glazed windows and other appurtenances of a civilized mansion upon the <unk> in front are palmtrees standing erect here and there like <unk> the <unk> office a small building by itself is inclosed by the same picket which <unk> in the <unk> we found the office closed but in the <unk> of the <unk> was a lady performing a <unk> operation on the head of a <unk> elderly european in a low white <unk> most domestic little scene i had witnessed since leaving home bent upon an interview with <unk> the sailors now <unk> the doctor to step forward as a polite <unk> after his health the pair stared very hard as he advanced but no ways disconcerted he saluted them gravely and inquired for the <unk> upon being informed that he had gone down to the beach we proceeded in that direction and soon met a native who told us that apprised of our vicinity <unk> was keeping out of the way we resolved to meet him and passing through the village he suddenly came walking toward us having apparently made up his mind that any attempt to elude us would be useless what do you want of me you rascals he <unk> greeting which provoked a retort in no measured terms at this juncture the natives began to crowd round and several foreigners strolled along caught in the very act of speaking to such <unk> acquaintances <unk> now <unk> and moved rapidly toward his office the men following turning upon them incensed he bade them be <unk> would have nothing more to say to us and then hurriedly addressing captain <unk> in <unk> he <unk> on and never stopped till the <unk> of <unk> <unk> was closed behind him our good old <unk> was now highly excited <unk> about in his huge <unk> and <unk> us to return to the <unk> after a little <unk> we acquiesced this interview was <unk> sensible that none of the charges brought against us would stand yet unwilling <unk> to withdraw them the <unk> now wished to get rid of us altogether but without being suspected of encouraging our escape thus only could we account for his conduct some of the party however with a devotion to principle truly heroic swore they would never leave him happen what might for my own part i began to long for a change and as there seemed to be no getting away in a ship i resolved to hit upon some other <unk> but first i cast about for a comrade and of course the long doctor was chosen we at once laid our heads together and for the present resolved to <unk> nothing to the rest a few days previous i had fallen in with a couple of yankee lads <unk> who originally <unk> their ship at <unk> island an uninhabited spot but exceedingly <unk> in fruit of all kinds had after a long residence there <unk> about among the society group they were last from <unk> island immediately <unk> they had been in the employ of two foreigners who had recently started a plantation there these persons they said had charged them to send over from <unk> if they could two white men for <unk> now all but the prospect of digging and <unk> <unk> us exactly but the opportunity for leaving the island was not to be <unk> and so we held ourselves in readiness to return with the <unk> who in a day or two were expected to visit <unk> in their boat at the interview which ensued we were introduced to them as peter and paul and they agreed to give peter and paul fifteen silver dollars a month promising something more should we remain with them permanently what they wanted was men who would stay to elude the <unk> of whom not exactly understanding our relations with the <unk> might <unk> us were they to see us <unk> coming midnight was appointed for that purpose when the hour drew nigh we disclosed our intention to the rest some <unk> us for <unk> them others <unk> and said that on the first opportunity they would follow our example at last we bade them farewell and there would now be a serene sadness in thinking over the <unk> we never saw them <unk> not all been dashed by <unk> picking the doctors pocket of a jackknife in the very act of embracing him we stole down to the beach where under the shadow of a grove the boat was waiting after some delay we shipped the oars and pulling outside of the reef set the sail and with a fair wind glided away for <unk> it was a pleasant trip the moon was <unk> air <unk> waves <unk> all above was the tropical night one purple vault hung round with soft trembling stars the channel is some five leagues wide on one hand you have the three great peaks of tahiti <unk> it over ranges of mountains and valleys and on the other the equally romantic elevations of <unk> high above which a lone peak called by our companions the <unk> shot up its verdant spire the <unk> were quite sociable they had been seafaring men and this of course was a bond between us to <unk> it a flask of wine was produced one of several which had been procured in person from the french admirals steward for whom the <unk> when on a former visit to <unk> had done a good turn by <unk> the <unk> frenchman to the ladies ashore besides this they had a calabash filled with wild boars meat baked yams breadfruit and <unk> potatoes pipes and tobacco also were produced and while regaling ourselves plenty of stories were told about the neighbouring islands at last we heard the roar of the <unk> reef and gliding through a break floated over the expanse within which was smooth as a young girls brow and beached the boat chapter <unk> the valley of <unk> we went up through groves to an open space where we heard voices and a light was seen <unk> from out a bamboo dwelling it was the <unk> retreat and in their absence several girls were keeping house assisted by an old native who wrapped up in tappa lay in the corner smoking a hasty meal was prepared and after it we essayed a nap but alas a plague little anticipated prevented unknown in tahiti the <unk> here fairly <unk> round us but more of them anon we were up <unk> and strolled out to view the country we were in the valley of <unk> shut in on both sides by lofty hills here and there were steep cliffs gay with <unk> <unk> or hung with <unk> vines swinging blossoms in the air of considerable width at the sea the vale <unk> as it runs inland terminating at the distance of several miles in a range of the most grotesque elevations which seem <unk> with <unk> and towers grown over with verdure and waving with trees the valley itself is a wilderness of woodland with links of streams flashing through and narrow <unk> fairly <unk> through masses of foliage all alone in this wild place was the abode of the <unk> the only one back from the <unk> sole <unk> the few fishermen and their families dwelling in a small grove of cocoanut trees whose roots were washed by the sea the cleared tract which they occupied comprised some thirty acres level as a prairie part of which was under <unk> the whole being fenced in by a stout <unk> of trunks and boughs of trees <unk> firmly in the ground this was necessary as a <unk> against the wild cattle and hogs <unk> the island thus far <unk> potatoes were the principal <unk> raised a ready sale for them being obtained among the shipping touching at <unk> there was a small patch of the <unk> or indian <unk> also another of yams and in one corner a <unk> growth of the <unk> just <unk> on the side of the inclosure next the sea was the house newly built of bamboos in the native style the furniture consisted of a couple of <unk> an old box a few cooking <unk> and <unk> tools together with three <unk> hanging from a <unk> and two enormous hammocks swinging in opposite corners and composed of dried <unk> hides stretched out with poles the whole plantation was shut in by a dense forest and close by the house a <unk> <unk> or species of <unk> had purposely been left twisting over the <unk> in the most grotesque manner and thus made a pleasant shade the branches of this curious tree afforded low <unk> upon which the natives frequently <unk> after the fashion of their race and smoked and <unk> by the hour we had a good breakfast of <unk> by the natives before sunrise on the <unk> of indian <unk> <unk> bananas and roasted breadfruit during the repast our new friends were quite sociable and <unk> it seems that like nearly all <unk> foreigners <unk> in polynesia they had some time previous deserted from a ship and having heard a good deal about the money to be made by raising supplies for <unk> they determined upon embarking in the business strolling about with this intention they at last came to <unk> and thinking the soil would suit set themselves to work they began by finding out the owner of the particular spot <unk> and then making a <unk> of him he turned out to be <unk> the chief of the fishermen who one day when <unk> with brandy tore his meagre tappa from his loins and gave me to know that he was <unk> by blood with <unk> herself and that his mother came from the illustrious race of <unk> who in old times swayed their bamboo <unk> over all the pagans of <unk> a regal and right reverend <unk> but at the time i speak of the dusky noble was in decayed circumstances and therefore by no means unwilling to <unk> a few useless acres as an equivalent he received from the strangers two or three rheumatic old muskets several red woollen shirts and a promise to be provided for in his old age he was always to find a home with the <unk> desirous of living on the cosy footing of a <unk> he frankly offered his two daughters for wives but as such they were politely declined the adventurers though not averse to <unk> being unwilling to <unk> themselves in a <unk> alliance however splendid in point of family <unk> men the fishermen of the grove were a sad set secluded in a great measure from the <unk> of the missionaries they gave themselves up to all manner of lazy wickedness strolling among the trees of a morning you came upon them <unk> on the shady side of a canoe hauled up among the bushes lying on a tree smoking or more frequently still gambling with pebbles though a little tobacco <unk> what they <unk> for at their outlandish games it would be hard to tell other idle <unk> they had also in which they seemed to take great delight as for fishing it employed but a small part of their time upon the whole they were a merry <unk> <unk> race <unk> the old sinner leaning against the fallen trunk of a cocoanut tree invariably <unk> his mornings at pebbles a <unk> <unk> of a native regularly plucking him of every other stick of tobacco obtained from his friends the <unk> toward afternoon he strolled back to their abode where he tarried till the next morning smoking and <unk> and at times <unk> about the hapless fortunes of the house of <unk> but like any other <unk> old <unk> he seemed for the most part perfectly content with cheerful board and <unk> on the whole the valley of <unk> was the <unk> place imaginable could the <unk> be induced to <unk> one might spend the month of august there quite pleasantly but this was not the case with the luckless long ghost and myself as will presently be seen chapter <unk> <unk> in polynesia the <unk> were both <unk> fellows but in other respects as unlike as possible one was a tall robust yankee <unk> in the <unk> of maine sallow and with a long <unk> other was a short little <unk> who had first clapped his eyes on the monument the voice of <unk> the yankee had a <unk> like a cracked <unk> and <unk> as his comrade called him <unk> the <unk> from every word beginning with one the latter though not the <unk> man in the world was a <unk> young fellow of twentyfive his cheeks were dyed with the fine <unk> red burned deeper from his roving life his blue eye opened well and a profusion of fair hair curled over a <unk> head but <unk> was no beauty a strong ugly man he was well adapted for <unk> <unk> and that was all his eyes were made to see with and not for <unk> compared with the <unk> he was grave and rather <unk> but there was a deal of good old humour <unk> up in him after all for the rest he was frank <unk> <unk> and resolute and like <unk> quite <unk> though a curious <unk> the pair got along together <unk> but as no two men were ever united in any enterprise without one getting the upper hand of the other so in most matters <unk> had his own way <unk> too had <unk> from him a spirit of invincible industry and heaven only knows what ideas of making a fortune on their plantation we were much concerned at this for the prospect of their setting us in their own persons an example of downright hard <unk> was anything but agreeable but it was now too late to <unk> what we had done the first <unk> <unk> did nothing having treated us as guests thus far they no doubt thought it would be wanting in delicacy to set us to work before the compliments of the occasion were well over the next morning however they both looked businesslike and we were put to wall <unk> boys said <unk> knocking the ashes out of his pipe after <unk> must get at it <unk> give peter there the doctor the big hoe and paul the other and lets be off going to a corner <unk> brought forth three of the implements and <unk> them <unk> <unk> on after his <unk> who took the lead with something in the shape of an axe for a moment left alone in the house we looked at each other <unk> we were each <unk> with a great clumsy piece of a tree armed at one end with a heavy flat mass of iron the <unk> <unk> adapted to a primitive <unk> an <unk> from <unk> the <unk> must have been of domestic manufacture <unk> <unk> had heard of and seen but they were harmless in comparison with the tools in our hands whats to be done with them inquired i of peter lift them up and down he replied or put them in motion some way or other paul we are in a <unk> hark they are calling and <unk> the <unk> off we marched our destination was the farther side of the plantation where the ground cleared in part had not yet been broken up but they were now setting about it upon halting i asked why a <unk> was not used some of the young wild <unk> might be caught and trained for draught <unk> replied that for such a purpose no cattle to his knowledge had ever been used in any part of polynesia as for the soil of <unk> so <unk> was it with roots crossing and <unk> each other at all points that no kind of a <unk> could be used to advantage the heavy <unk> <unk> were the only thing for such land our work was now before us but previous to <unk> operations i endeavoured to engage the yankee in a little further friendly chat concerning the nature of virgin <unk> in general and that of the valley of <unk> in particular so masterly a <unk> made long ghost <unk> up and he stood by ready to join in but what our friend had to say about <unk> all referred to the particular part of his plantation upon which we stood and having communicated enough on this head to enable us to set to work to the best advantage he fell to himself and <unk> who had been looking on followed suit the surface here and there presented closely <unk> branches of what had once been a dense <unk> they seemed purposely left projecting as if to furnish a handle whereby to drag out the roots beneath after <unk> the hard soil by <unk> of much <unk> and <unk> the yankee <unk> one of the roots this way and that twisting it round and round and then <unk> at it horizontally come <unk> us a hand he cried at last and running up we all four strained away in concert the tough obstacle <unk> the surface with throes and <unk> but stuck fast notwithstanding <unk> it cried <unk> well have to get a rope run to the house <unk> and fetch one the end of this being attached we took plenty of room and strained away once more give us a song <unk> said the doctor who was rather sociable on a short acquaintance where the work to be accomplished is any way difficult this mode of <unk> toil is quite <unk> among sailors so willing to make everything as cheerful as possible <unk> struck up were you ever in <unk> a <unk> <unk> but somewhat <unk> windlass chorus at last the yankee cast a <unk> on his enthusiasm by exclaiming in a <unk> oh <unk> your singing keep quiet and pull away this we now did in the most <unk> silence until with a jerk that made every elbow hum the root dragged out and most <unk> we all landed upon the ground the doctor quite exhausted stayed there and <unk> into believing that after so <unk> a performance we would be allowed a cessation of toil took off his hat and fanned himself <unk> a hard customer that peter observed the yankee going up to him but its no use for any on em to hang back for im <unk> if they <unk> got to come out whether or no hurrah lets get at it <unk> mercy <unk> the doctor rising slowly and turning round hell be the death of us falling to with our <unk> again we worked <unk> or together as occasion required until <unk> time came the period so called by the <unk> embraced about three hours in the middle of the day during which it was so <unk> hot in this still brooding valley shut out from the trades and only open toward the leeward side of the island that <unk> in the sun was out of the question to use a <unk> phrase of <unk> it was <unk> enough to <unk> the nose <unk> a brass monkey returning to the house <unk> assisted by old <unk> cooked the dinner and after we had all <unk> thereof both the <unk> and <unk> threw themselves into one of the hammocks inviting us to occupy the other thinking it no bad idea we did so and after <unk> with the <unk> managed to fall into a doze as for the <unk> more accustomed to <unk> they at once presented a <unk> back to each other and were soon <unk> away at a great rate <unk> <unk> on a mat in one corner at last we were roused by <unk> crying out up <unk> up rise and shine time to get at it <unk> looking at the doctor i perceived very plainly that he had decided upon something in a languid voice he told <unk> that he was not very well indeed that he had not been himself for some time past though a little rest no doubt would recruit him the yankee thinking from this that our valuable services might be lost to him altogether were he too hard upon us at the outset at once begged us both to <unk> our own feelings and not exert ourselves for the present unless we felt like it <unk> <unk> the fact that my comrade claimed to be actually <unk> simply suggested that since he was so <unk> he had better perhaps swing in his hammock for the rest of the day if agreeable however i myself might accompany him upon a little <unk> <unk> in the neighbouring hills in this proposition i gladly acquiesced though peter who was a great <unk> put on a long face the muskets and <unk> were forthwith got from overhead and everything being then ready <unk> cried out <unk> come <unk> get up we want you for pilot <unk> my lad look <unk> things you know and if you likes why theres them roots in the field yonder having thus arranged his domestic affairs to please himself though little to <unk> satisfaction i thought he slung his <unk> over his shoulder and we started <unk> was at once sent on in advance and leaving the plantation he struck into a path which led toward the mountains after hurrying through the thickets for some time we came out into the sunlight in an open glade just under the shadow of the hills here <unk> pointed aloft to a <unk> crag far distant where a <unk> with horns thrown back stood like a statue chapter <unk> some account of the wild cattle in polynesia before we proceed further a word or two concerning these wild cattle and the way they came on the island some fifty years ago <unk> left several <unk> sheep and <unk> at various places in the society group he <unk> the natives to look after the animals carefully and by no means to slaughter any until a considerable stock had accumulated the sheep must have died off for i never saw a solitary fleece in any part of polynesia the pair left were an <unk> couple perhaps separated in disgust and died without issue as for the <unk> occasionally you come across a black <unk> ram <unk> the <unk> <unk> of some height inaccessible to man in <unk> to the sweet <unk> of the valley below the <unk> are not very numerous the <unk> coming of a <unk> <unk> are a hearty set <unk> over the island of <unk> in considerable numbers though in tahiti but few of them are seen at the former place the original pair must have <unk> off to the interior since it is now so thickly <unk> by their wild <unk> the herds are the private property of queen <unk> from whom the <unk> had obtained permission to shoot for their own use as many as they pleased the natives stand in great awe of these cattle and for this reason are <unk> timid in crossing the island <unk> rather to sail round to an opposite village in their canoes <unk> <unk> in <unk> stories most of which by the <unk> had a <unk> of the marvellous the following is one of these once upon a time he was going over the hills with a <unk> no <unk> a great bull came <unk> out of a wood and both took to their heels the old chief sprang into a tree his companion flying in an opposite direction was pursued and in the very act of reaching up to a bough <unk> <unk> the unhappy man was then <unk> in the <unk> finally run away with on the <unk> horns more dead than alive <unk> waited till all was over and then made the best of his way home the <unk> armed with two or three muskets at once started to recover if possible his unfortunate brothers remains at nightfall they returned without discovering any trace of him but the next morning <unk> himself caught a glimpse of the <unk> marching across the mountains brow with a long dark object borne aloft on his horns having referred to <unk> attempts to <unk> the islands with useful <unk> we may as well say something concerning his success upon <unk> one of the largest islands in the whole polynesian archipelago and which gives the native name to the wellknown cluster named by cook in honour of lord sandwich <unk> is some one hundred leagues in circuit and covers an area of over four thousand miles until within a few years past its interior was almost unknown even to the inhabitants themselves who for ages had been prevented from wandering thither by certain strange superstitions <unk> the terrific <unk> of the volcanoes mount <unk> and mount <unk> was supposed to guard all the passes to the extensive valleys lying round their base there are legends of her having chased with streams of fire several impious adventurers near <unk> a <unk> cliff is shown with the vitreous torrent apparently pouring over into the sea just as it cooled after one of these supernatural <unk> to these inland valleys and the adjoining hillsides which are clothed in the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> soon wandered and unmolested for a long period multiplied in vast herds some twelve or fifteen years ago the natives lost sight of their superstitions and learning the value of the hides in commerce began hunting the creatures that wore them but being very fearful and <unk> in a business so novel their success was small and it was not until the arrival of a party of spanish hunters men regularly trained to their calling upon the plains of <unk> that the work of slaughter was fairly begun the spaniards were <unk> fellows <unk> out in gay blankets <unk> worked with <unk> quills and jingling spurs mounted upon trained indian <unk> these heroes pursued their prey up to the very base of the burning mountains making the profoundest solitudes ring with their shouts and flinging the <unk> under the very nose of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a village upon the coast was their place of resort and thither <unk> roving whites from all the islands of the group as pupils of the dashing spaniards many of these <unk> fellows <unk> too freely of the <unk> and <unk> headlong after the herds when they reeled in the saddle were <unk> and killed this was about the year <unk> when the present king <unk> iii was a lad with royal <unk> laying claim to the sole property of the cattle he was delighted with the idea of receiving one of every two silver dollars paid down for their hides so with no thought for the future the work of <unk> went madly on in three years time eighteen thousand <unk> were slain almost entirely upon the single island of <unk> the herds being thus nearly destroyed the sagacious young prince imposed a <unk> taboo upon the few surviving cattle which was to remain in force for ten years during this <unk> yet <unk> hunting is forbidden unless directly <unk> by the king the massacre of the cattle extended to the hapless <unk> in one year three thousand of their skins were sold to the merchants of <unk> fetching a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> after this <unk> it is time to run on after <unk> and the yankee chapter <unk> a hunting <unk> with <unk> at the foot of the mountain a steep path went up among rocks and clefts <unk> with verdure here and there were green <unk> down which it made one giddy to peep at last we gained an overhanging wooded shelf of land which crowned the heights and along this the path well shaded ran like a gallery in every direction the scenery was <unk> there was a low rustling breeze and below in the vale the leaves were quivering the sea lay blue and serene in the distance and inland the surface swelled up ridge after ridge and peak upon peak all bathed in the indian haze of the tropics and dreamy to look upon still valleys leagues away reposed in the deep shadows of the mountains and here and there <unk> lifted up their voices in the solitude high above all and central the <unk> lifted its finger upon the hillsides small groups of <unk> were seen some quietly <unk> others slowly winding into the valleys we went on directing our course for a slope of these hills a mile or two further where the nearest <unk> were seen we were cautious in keeping to the windward of them their sense of smell and hearing being like those of all wild creatures exceedingly <unk> as there was no knowing that we might not surprise some other kind of game in the <unk> through which we were passing we crept along <unk> the wild hogs of the island are uncommonly fierce and as they often attack the natives i could not help following <unk> example of once in a while peeping in under the foliage frequent <unk> glances also served to assure me that our retreat was not cut off as we rounded a <unk> of bushes a noise behind them like the <unk> of dry branches broke the stillness in an instant <unk> hand was on a bough ready for a spring and <unk> finger touched the <unk> of his piece again the stillness was broken and thinking it high time to get ready i brought my musket to my shoulder look sharp cried the yankee and dropping on one knee he brushed the twigs aside presently off went his piece and with a wild <unk> a black bristling <unk> <unk> red lip curled up by two glittering <unk> unharmed across the path and <unk> through the opposite <unk> i saluted him with a charge as he disappeared but not the slightest notice was taken of the civility by this time <unk> the illustrious <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was twenty feet from the ground <unk> come down you old fool cried the yankee the <unk> <unk> on <unk> side of the island afore this i <unk> guess he continued as we began <unk> that weve spoiled sport by firing at that ere <unk> <unk> them <unk> heard the <unk> and are flinging their tails about now on the keen jump quick paul and lets climb that rock yonder and see if so be theres any in sight but none were to be seen except at such a distance that they looked like <unk> as evening was now at hand my companion proposed our returning home forthwith and then after a sound nights rest starting in the morning upon a good days hunt with the whole force of the plantation following another pass in descending into the valley we passed through some nobly wooded land on the face of the mountain one variety of tree particularly attracted my attention the dark mossy stem over seventy feet high was perfectly <unk> for many feet above the ground when it shot out in broad boughs laden with lustrous leaves of the deepest green and all round the lower part of the trunk thin <unk> <unk> of bark perfectly smooth and radiating from a common centre projected along the ground for at least two yards from below these natural <unk> <unk> upward until gradually blended with the trunk itself there were signs of the wild cattle having sheltered themselves behind them <unk> called this the canoe tree as in old times it supplied the navies of the kings of tahiti for canoe building the woods is still used being extremely dense and <unk> to worms it is very <unk> emerging from the forest when <unk> down the hillside we came upon an open space covered with ferns and grass over which a few lonely trees were casting long shadows in the setting sun here a piece of ground some hundred feet square covered with weeds and <unk> and sounding hollow to the tread was inclosed by a ruinous wall of stones <unk> said it was an almost forgotten <unk> of great antiquity where no one had been <unk> since the islanders had been christians sealed up in dry deep vaults many a dead heathen was lying here curious to prove the old mans statement i was anxious to get a peep at the catacombs but <unk> overgrown with <unk> as they were no aperture was visible before gaining the level of the valley we passed by the site of a village near a <unk> long since deserted there was nothing but stone walls and rude dismantled foundations of houses constructed of the same material large trees and <unk> were growing <unk> among them i asked <unk> how long it was since <unk> had lived here me <unk> <unk> <unk> men <unk> he replied now only poor <unk> <unk> fishermen <unk> born here going down the valley <unk> of every kind presented a different aspect from that of the high land chief among the trees of the plain on this island is the <unk> large and lofty with a massive trunk and broad <unk> leaves the wood is splendid in tahiti i was shown a narrow polished plank fit to make a <unk> for a king taken from the heart of the tree it was of a deep rich <unk> traced with yellow veins and in some places clouded with <unk> in the same grove with the regal ah you may see the beautiful <unk> <unk> its pyramid of shining leaves <unk> with numberless small white blossoms planted with trees as the valley is almost throughout its entire length i was astonished to observe so very few which were useful to the natives not one in a hundred was a cocoanut or breadfruit tree but here <unk> again enlightened me in the <unk> religious hostilities which ensued upon the conversion of christianity of the first <unk> a <unk> from tahiti destroyed by <unk> the bark entire groves of these invaluable trees for some time afterwards they stood stark and <unk> in the sun sad <unk> of the fate which befell the inhabitants of the valley chapter <unk> <unk> the night following the hunting trip long ghost and myself after a valiant <unk> had to fly the house on account of the <unk> and here i cannot avoid relating a story rife among the natives concerning the manner in which these insects were introduced upon the island some years previous a whaling captain touching at an adjoining bay got into difficulty with its inhabitants and at last carried his complaint before one of the native <unk> but receiving no satisfaction and deeming himself <unk> he resolved upon taking signal revenge one night he towed a rotten old <unk> ashore and left it in a neglected <unk> patch where the ground was warm and moist hence the <unk> i tried my best to learn the name of this man and hereby do what i can to hand it down to posterity it was <unk> <unk> the ship belonged to nantucket when tormented by the <unk> i found much relief in <unk> the word <unk> with another of one syllable and pronouncing them together <unk> the doctor suggested a walk to the beach where there was a long low shed tumbling to pieces but open lengthwise to a current of air which he thought might keep off the <unk> so thither we went the ruin partially sheltered a <unk> of times gone by which a few days after we examined with much curiosity it was an old <unk> <unk> to dust being supported by the same rude blocks upon which apparently it had years before been <unk> out in all probability it had never been afloat outside it seemed originally stained of a green colour which here and there was now changed into a <unk> purple the prow terminated in a high <unk> beak both sides were covered with carving and upon the stern was something which long ghost maintained to be the arms of the royal house of <unk> the device had an <unk> look <unk> two sharks with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> a knot left projecting from the wood the canoe was at least forty feet long about two wide and four deep the upper <unk> of narrow planks laced together with cords of <unk> in many places fallen off and lay <unk> upon the ground still there were ample <unk> left for sleeping and in we <unk> doctor into the bow and i into the stern i soon fell asleep but waking suddenly <unk> in every joint from my constrained posture i thought for an instant that i must have been <unk> screwed down in my coffin presenting my compliments to long ghost i asked how it fared with him bad enough he replied as he tossed about in the outlandish <unk> lying in the bottom of our couch <unk> how these old mats smell as he continued talking in this <unk> strain for some time i at last made no reply having resumed certain mathematical reveries to induce repose but finding the <unk> table of no avail i summoned up a <unk> image of chaos in a sort of sliding <unk> and was just falling into a nap on the strength of it when i heard a solitary and distinct <unk> the hour of my calamity was at hand one blended hum the creature darted into the canoe like a small swordfish and i out of it upon getting into the open air to my surprise there was long ghost fanning himself wildly with an old paddle he had just made a noiseless escape from a swarm which had attacked his own end of the canoe it was now proposed to try the water so a small fishing canoe hauled up near by was quickly launched and paddling a good distance off we dropped overboard the native contrivance for an <unk> heavy stone attached to a cable of braided bark at this part of the island the <unk> reef was close to the shore leaving the water within smooth and extremely shallow it was a blessed thought we knew nothing till sunrise when the motion of our <unk> cot awakened us i looked up and beheld <unk> <unk> toward the shore and towing us after him by the bark cable pointing to the reef he told us we had had a narrow escape it was true enough the <unk> had rolled our stone out of its <unk> and we had floated away chapter <unk> the second hunt in the mountains fair dawned over the hills of <unk> the <unk> morning of our hunt everything had been prepared for it <unk> and when we arrived at the house a good breakfast was spread by <unk> and old <unk> was <unk> about like an <unk> several of his men also were in attendance to accompany us with calabashes of food and in case we met with any success to <unk> as <unk> of <unk> on our return apprised the evening previous of the <unk> sport the doctor had announced his <unk> to take part therein now subsequent events made us regard this expedition as a <unk> device of the yankees once get us off on a pleasure trip and with what face could we afterward refuse to work beside he enjoyed all the credit of giving us a holiday nor did he omit assuring us that work or play our wages were all the while running on a dilapidated old musket of <unk> was borrowed for the doctor it was exceedingly short and heavy with a clumsy lock which required a strong finger to pull the <unk> on trying the piece by firing at a mark long ghost was satisfied that it could not fail of doing execution the charge went one way and he the other upon this he endeavoured to <unk> an exchange of muskets with <unk> but the <unk> was proof against his <unk> at last he <unk> his weapon to one of the natives to carry for him <unk> our forces we started for the head of the valley near which a path ascended to a range of high land said to be a favourite resort of the cattle shortly after gaining the heights a small herd some way off was perceived entering a wood we hurried on and dividing our party went in after them at four different points each white man followed by several natives i soon found myself in a dense covert and after looking round was just emerging into a clear space when i heard a report and a bullet knocked the bark from a tree near by the same instant there was a trampling and <unk> and five <unk> nearly abreast broke into view across the opening and plunged right toward the spot where myself and three of the islanders were standing they were small black <unk> creatures with short sharp horns red nostrils and eyes like coals of fire on they <unk> dark <unk> heads hanging down by this time my island <unk> were <unk> among the trees glancing round for an instant to discover a retreat in case of <unk> i raised my piece when a voice cried out from the wood right between the <unk> paul right between the <unk> down went my barrel in range with a small white tuft on the forehead of the <unk> one and letting him have it i darted to one side as i turned again the five <unk> shot by like a blast making the air eddy in their wake the yankee now burst into view and saluted them in flank whereupon the fierce little bull with the tufted forehead <unk> his long tail over his <unk> kicked out with his <unk> feet and shot forward a full length it was nothing but a <unk> and in an instant they were out of sight the <unk> into which they broke rocking overhead and marking their progress the action over the heavy artillery came up in the person of the long doctor with the <unk> where are they he cried out of breath a mile or two <unk> by this time replied the <unk> lord paul i you ought <unk> sent an <unk> into that little black <unk> while <unk> my want of skill as well as i could <unk> rushing forward suddenly exclaimed creation what are you bout there peter peter incensed at our ill luck and <unk> <unk> it to the <unk> of our native <unk> was bringing his piece to bear upon his trembling <unk> <unk> descending a tree pulling <unk> the bullet went high over his head and <unk> to the ground <unk> like a <unk> the fellow ran away as fast as his heels could carry him the rest followed us after this with fear and trembling after forming our line of march anew we went on for several hours without catching a glimpse of the game the reports of the muskets having been heard at a great distance at last we mounted a <unk> height to obtain a wide view of the country <unk> this place we beheld three cattle quietly <unk> in a green opening of a wood below the trees <unk> them in all round a general <unk> of the muskets now took place followed by a hasty lunch from the calabashes we then started as we descended the <unk> the cattle were in plain sight until we entered the forest when we lost sight of them for a moment but only to see them again as we crept close up to the spot where they <unk> they were a bull a <unk> and a <unk> the <unk> was lying down in the shade by the edge of the wood the <unk> sprawling out before her in the grass <unk> her lips while old <unk> himself stood close by casting a paternal glance at this domestic little scene and <unk> elevating his nose in the air now then said <unk> in a whisper lets take the poor <unk> while they are <unk> together crawl along <unk> crawl along fire together mind and not till i say the word we crept up to the very edge of the open ground and <unk> behind a <unk> of bushes resting our levelled barrels among the branches the slight rustling was heard <unk> turned round dropped his head to the ground and sent forth a low sullen <unk> then snuffed the air the <unk> rose on her <unk> pitched forward <unk> and stood upon her legs while the <unk> with ears pricked got right underneath her all three were now grouped and in an instant would be off i take the bull cried our leader fire the <unk> fell like a <unk> its dam uttered a cry and thrust her head into the <unk> but she turned and came moaning up to the lifeless <unk> going round and round it snuffing fiercely with her bleeding nostrils a <unk> in the wood and a loud roar announced the flying bull soon another shot was fired and the <unk> fell leaving some of the natives to look after the dead cattle the rest of us hurried on after the bull his dreadful <unk> <unk> us to the spot where he lay wounded in the shoulder in his fright and agony he had bounded into the wood but when we came up to him he had sunk to the earth in a green hollow thrusting his black muzzle into a pool of his own blood and tossing it over his hide in <unk> the yankee brought his piece to a rest and the next instant the wild brute sprang into the air and with his <unk> crouching under him fell dead our island friends were now in high spirits all courage and alacrity old <unk> thought nothing of taking poor <unk> himself by the horns and peering into his glazed eyes our ship knives were at once in request and <unk> the cattle we hung them high up by cords of bark from the boughs of a tree withdrawing into a covert we there waited for the wild hogs which according to <unk> would soon make their appearance lured by the smell of blood presently we heard them coming in two or three different directions and in a moment they were tearing the <unk> to pieces as only one shot at these creatures could be relied on we intended firing simultaneously but somehow or other the doctors piece went off by itself and one of the hogs dropped the others then breaking into the <unk> the rest of us sprang after them resolved to have another shot at all hazards the <unk> darted among some bushes and a few moments after we heard the report of his musket followed by a quick cry on running up we saw our comrade doing battle with a young devil of a <unk> as black as night whose <unk> had been partly torn away firing when the game was in full career and coming directly toward him <unk> had been assailed by the enraged brute it was now <unk> the <unk> of the musket with which he had tried to club it <unk> holding fast to the barrel and <unk> his waist for a knife being in advance of the others i clapped my gun to the boars head and so put an end to the contest evening now coming on we set to work <unk> our <unk> the cattle were so small that a stout native could walk off with an entire quarter brushing through thickets and descending rocks without an apparent effort though to tell the truth no white man present could have done the thing with any ease as for the wild hogs none of the islanders could be induced to carry <unk> some invincible superstition being connected with its black colour we were therefore obliged to leave it the other a spotted one being slung by green <unk> to a pole was marched off with by two young natives with our <unk> of <unk> ahead we then commenced our return down the valley <unk> home darkness overtook us in the woods and <unk> became necessary we stopped and made them of dry palm branches and then sending two lads on in advance for the purpose of gathering fuel to feed the <unk> we continued our journey it was a wild sight the <unk> waved aloft flashed through the forest and where the ground admitted the islanders went along on a brisk <unk> notwithstanding they bent forward under their <unk> their naked backs were stained with blood and occasionally running by each other they raised wild cries which startled the hillsides chapter <unk> the <unk> and a visit to <unk> two <unk> and a <unk> no bad trophies of our days sport so by <unk> we marched into the plantation the wild <unk> rocking from its pole and the doctor singing an old <unk> the chorus of which swelled high above the yells of the natives we resolved to make a night of it kindling a great fire just outside the dwelling and hanging one of the <unk> quarters from a limb of the <unk> <unk> was at liberty to cut and <unk> for himself baskets of roasted breadfruit and plenty of <unk> pudding bunches of bananas and young cocoanuts had also been provided by the natives against our return the fire burned bravely keeping off the <unk> and making every mans face glow like a <unk> of port the meat had the true <unk> flavour not at all <unk> by our famous <unk> and a couple of flasks of white brandy which <unk> producing from his secret store <unk> freely there was no end to my long comrades spirits after telling his stories and singing his songs he sprang to his feet clasped a young damsel of the grove round the waist and <unk> over the grass with her but theres no telling all the <unk> he played that night the natives who delight in a wag emphatically pronounced him <unk> it was long after midnight ere we broke up but when the rest had retired <unk> with the true <unk> of a yankee salted down what was left of the meat the next day was sunday and at my request <unk> accompanied me to <unk> neighbouring bay and the seat of a mission almost directly opposite <unk> in <unk> is a large church and <unk> both quite dilapidated and planted amid <unk> on a fine <unk> stands a very tasteful cottage commanding a view across the channel in passing i caught sight of a graceful calico <unk> <unk> from the piazza through a <unk> the place was the residence of the missionary a trim little <unk> was dancing out at her <unk> a few yards from the beach straggling over the low lands in the vicinity were several native <unk> <unk> much better every way than most of those in tahiti we attended service at the church where we found but a small congregation and after what i had seen in <unk> nothing very interesting took place but the audience had a curious <unk> look which i knew not how to account for until we <unk> that a sermon with the <unk> <unk> for a text was being <unk> it seemed that there lived an englishman in the district who like our friends the <unk> was <unk> <unk> potatoes for the <unk> market in spite of all his precautions the natives were in the habit of making <unk> <unk> into his inclosure and carrying off the potatoes one night he fired a <unk> charged with <unk> and salt at several shadows which he discovered stealing across his premises they fled but it was like <unk> anything else the knaves stole again with a greater relish than ever and the very next night he caught a party in the act of <unk> a <unk> of potatoes under his own <unk> at last he stated his <unk> to the missionary who for the benefit of his congregation <unk> the sermon we heard now there were no thieves in <unk> but then the people of the valley were <unk> to be honest it was a regular business <unk> between them and the <unk> in consideration of so many potatoes to them in hand duly paid they were to <unk> from all <unk> upon the plantation another security against <unk> was the permanent residence upon the premises of their chief <unk> on our return to <unk> in the afternoon we found the doctor and <unk> making themselves comfortable the latter was reclining on the ground pipe in mouth watching the doctor who sitting like a turk before a large iron <unk> was <unk> potatoes and indian <unk> and now and then <unk> splinters from a bone all of which by turns were thrown into the <unk> he was making what he called <unk> <unk> in <unk> affairs my friend was something of an artist and by way of improving his knowledge did nothing the rest of the day but <unk> in what might be called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of meat and <unk> them to all sorts of <unk> operations it was the first fresh beef that either of us had tasted in more than a year oh yell pick up <unk> a while peter observed <unk> toward night as long ghost was turning a great rib over the <unk> dye think paul hell get along i dare say replied i he only wants to get those cheeks of his <unk> to tell the truth i was not a little pleased to see the doctors reputation as an invalid <unk> away so fast especially as on the strength of his being one he had promised to have such easy times of it and very likely too at my expense chapter <unk> the <unk> dozing in our canoe the next morning about daybreak we were awakened by <unk> hailing us loudly from the beach upon paddling up he told us that a canoe had arrived <unk> from <unk> with an order from a ship lying there for a supply of his potatoes and as they must be on board the vessel by noon he wanted us to assist in bringing them down to his <unk> my long comrade was one of those who from always thrusting forth the wrong foot foremost when they rise or <unk> some other <unk> of the limbs are more or less <unk> or sullen before breakfast it was in vain therefore that the yankee <unk> the <unk> of the case which obliged him to call us up thus <unk> doctor only looked the more <unk> and said nothing in reply at last by way of getting up a little enthusiasm for the occasion the yankee exclaimed quite <unk> what dye say then <unk> shall we get at it yes in the devils name replied the doctor like a snapping turtle and we moved on to the house notwithstanding his <unk> answer he probably thought that after the <unk> performance of the day previous it would hardly do to hang back at the house we found <unk> ready with the <unk> and we at once repaired to the farther side of the inclosure where the potatoes had yet to be taken out of the ground the rich tawny soil seemed specially adapted to the <unk> the great yellow <unk> rolling out of the hills like eggs from a nest my comrade really surprised me by the zeal with which he applied himself to his hoe for my own part <unk> by the cool breath of the morning i worked away like a good fellow as for <unk> and the <unk> they seemed <unk> pleased at this evidence of our <unk> to exert ourselves it was not long ere all the potatoes were turned out and then came the worst of it they were to be <unk> down to the beach a distance of at least a quarter of a mile and there being no such thing as a <unk> or <unk> on the island there was nothing for it but <unk> and broad shoulders well knowing that this part of the business would be anything but agreeable <unk> did his best to put as encouraging a face upon it as possible and giving us no time to indulge in <unk> thoughts <unk> directed our attention to a pile of rude <unk> of stout <unk> had been provided for the occasion so without more ado we helped ourselves from the heap and soon we were all four staggering along under our <unk> the first trip down we arrived at the beach together <unk> enthusiastic cries proving irresistible a trip or two more however and my shoulders began to <unk> in their <unk> while the doctors tall figure <unk> an obvious <unk> presently we both threw down our baskets <unk> we could stand it no longer but our <unk> bent as it were upon getting the work out of us by a silent appeal to our moral sense toiled away without pretending to notice us it was as much as to say there men weve been boarding and <unk> ye for the last three days and yesterday ye did nothing earthly but eat so stand by now and look at us working if ye dare thus driven to it then we resumed our employment yet in spite of all we could do we <unk> behind <unk> and <unk> who breathing hard and <unk> at every <unk> toiled away without pause or cessation i almost <unk> wished that they would load themselves down with one <unk> too many gasping as i was with my own <unk> i could not for the life of me help laughing at long ghost there he <unk> long neck thrust forward his arms twisted behind him to form a shelf for his basket to rest on and his <unk> of legs every once in a while giving way under him as if his <unk> slipped either way there i carry no more he exclaimed all at once flinging his potatoes into the boat where the yankee was just then <unk> them away oh then said <unk> quite briskly i guess you and paul had better try the <unk> along ill fix ye out in no time and so saying he <unk> ashore and hurried back to the house bidding us follow wondering what upon earth the <unk> could be and rather suspicious of it we <unk> after on arriving at the house we found him getting ready a sort of <unk> it was nothing more than an old barrel suspended by a rope from the middle of a stout oar quite an ingenious contrivance of the yankees and his proposed arrangement with regard to mine and the doctors shoulders was equally so there now said he when everything was ready theres no <unk> about this you can stand right up under it you see <unk> try it once and he politely rested the blade of the oar on my comrades right shoulder and the other end on mine leaving the barrel between us <unk> the thing he added standing off <unk> while we remained in this interesting attitude there was no help for us with broken hearts and backs we <unk> back to the field the doctor all the while saying masses upon starting with the loaded barrel for a few paces we got along pretty well and were constrained to think the idea not a bad one but we did not long think so in less than five minutes we came to a dead halt the springing and <unk> of the clumsy oar being almost unendurable lets shift ends cried the doctor who did not relish the blade of the stick which was cutting into the blade of his shoulder at last by stages short and frequent we managed to <unk> down the beach where we again <unk> our cargo in something of a <unk> why not make the natives help asked long ghost rubbing his shoulder natives be <unk> said the yankee twenty on em aint worth one white man they never was meant to work any them chaps and they knows it too for <unk> little work any on em ever does but notwithstanding this abuse <unk> was at last obliged to press a few of the <unk> into service <unk> come here he shouted to several who reclining on a bank had hitherto been critical observers of our proceedings and among other things had been particularly <unk> by the performance with the <unk> after making these fellows load their baskets together the yankee filled his own and then drove them before him down to the beach probably he had seen the herds of <unk> <unk> driven in this way by mounted indians along the great callao to lima the boat at last loaded the yankee taking with him a couple of natives at once hoisted sail and stood across the channel for <unk> the next morning at breakfast old <unk> ran in and told us that the voyagers were returning we hurried down to the beach and saw the boat gliding toward us with a dozing islander at the helm and <unk> standing up in the bows jingling a small bag of silver the proceeds of his cargo chapter <unk> what they thought of us in <unk> several quiet days now passed away during which we just worked sufficiently to <unk> our <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> us from any severe toil their desire to retain us became more and more evident which was not to be wondered at for beside <unk> us from the beginning a couple of civil goodnatured fellows who would soon become quite <unk> with them they were not slow in perceiving that we were far different from the common run of rovers and that our society was both entertaining and <unk> to a couple of solitary <unk> men like themselves in a literary point of view indeed they soon regarded us with emotions of <unk> and wonder and the doctor was considered nothing short of a prodigy the <unk> found out that he the doctor could read a book <unk> down without even so much as <unk> the big words beforehand and the yankee in the twinkling of an eye received from him the sum total of several <unk> items stated aloud with the view of <unk> the extent of his mathematical lore then frequently in discoursing upon men and things my long comrade employed such imposing phrases that upon one occasion they actually remained <unk> while he talked in short their <unk> opinion of long ghost in particular rose higher and higher every day and they began to indulge in all manner of dreams concerning the <unk> to be derived from employing so learned a <unk> among other <unk> revealed was that of building a small craft of some forty tons for the purpose of <unk> among the neighbouring islands with a native crew we would then take turns cruising over the tranquil pacific touching here and there as caprice suggested and <unk> romantic articles of <unk> the <unk> <unk> ambergris <unk> cocoanut oil and <unk> <unk> this south sea <unk> was delightful to think of and straightway the doctor announced his <unk> to <unk> the future schooner clear of all shoals and reefs whatsoever his <unk> was audacious he enlarged upon the science of navigation treated us to a <unk> on <unk> sailing and the <unk> compass and went into an inexplicable explanation of the lord only knows what plan of his for infallibly settling the longitude whenever my comrade thus gave the <unk> to his fine fancy it was a treat to listen and therefore i never <unk> but with the <unk> sat in mute admiration before him this apparent <unk> on my part must have been considered as truly <unk> of our respective merits for to my no small concern i quickly perceived that in the estimate formed of us long ghost began to be <unk> far above myself for aught i knew indeed he might have privately thrown out a hint concerning the difference in our respective stations aboard the <unk> or else the <unk> must have considered him some illustrious individual for certain inscrutable reasons going <unk> with this idea of him his <unk> <unk> for work became <unk> and entertaining such views of extending their business they counted more upon his ultimate value to them as a man of science than as a mere <unk> nor did the humorous doctor forbear to <unk> an opinion every way so <unk> to himself at times for the sake of the joke assuming airs of superiority over myself which though <unk> enough were sometimes annoying to tell the plain truth things at last came to such a pass that i told him up and down that i had no notion to put up with his pretensions if he were going to play the gentleman i was going to follow suit and then there would quickly be an explosion at this he laughed heartily and after some <unk> chat we resolved upon leaving the valley as soon as we could do so with a proper regard to politeness at supper therefore the same evening the doctor hinted at our intention though much surprised and vexed <unk> moved not a <unk> peter said he at <unk> <unk> after mature <unk> would you like to do the cooking its easy work and you <unk> do anything else pauls <unk> he can work in the field when it <unk> him and before long well have ye at something more <unk> we <unk> <unk> assented doubtless the proposed arrangement was a snug one especially the <unk> for the doctor but i by no means <unk> the functions allotted to <unk> were too indefinite nothing final however was agreed <unk> intention to leave was revealed and that was enough for the present but as we said nothing further about going the yankee must have concluded that we might yet be induced to remain he redoubled his <unk> to make us <unk> it was during this state of affairs that one morning before breakfast we were set to <unk> in a <unk> and the <unk> being engaged at the house we were left to ourselves now though the pulling of weeds was considered by our <unk> an easy occupation for which reason they had assigned it to us and although as a garden <unk> it may be pleasant enough for those who like <unk> long persisted in the business becomes <unk> <unk> nevertheless we toiled away for some time until the doctor who from his height was obliged to <unk> at a very <unk> angle suddenly sprang upright and with one hand <unk> his spinal column exclaimed oh that ones joints were but provided with holes to drop a little oil through vain as the <unk> was for this proposed improvement upon our species i cordially responded thereto for every <unk> in my spine was <unk> in sympathy presently the sun rose over the mountains <unk> that deadly morning languor so fatal to early exertion in a warm climate we could stand it no longer but <unk> our <unk> moved on to the house resolved to <unk> no more upon the goodnature of the <unk> by continuing one moment longer in an occupation so extremely <unk> we freely told them so <unk> was exceedingly hurt and said everything he could think of to <unk> our determination but finding all <unk> he very <unk> urged us not to be in any hurry about leaving for we might stay with him as guests until we had time to decide upon our future movements we <unk> him <unk> but replied that the following morning we must turn our backs upon the hills of <unk> chapter <unk> preparing for the journey during the remainder of the day we <unk> about talking over our plans the doctor was all eagerness to visit <unk> a solitary inland village standing upon the banks of a considerable lake of the same name and <unk> among groves from <unk> you went to this place by a lonely <unk> leading through the <unk> scenery in the world much too we had heard concerning the lake itself which <unk> in such delicious fish that in former times <unk> parties occasionally came over to it from <unk> upon its banks moreover grew the finest fruit of the islands and in their greatest perfection the <unk> or brazilian <unk> here attained the size of an orange and the gorgeous <unk> or red apple of tahiti <unk> with deeper <unk> than in any of the seaward valleys beside all this in <unk> dwelt the most beautiful and unsophisticated women in the entire society group in short the village was so remote from the coast and had been so much less affected by recent <unk> than other places that in most things <unk> life was here seen as formerly <unk> in the days of young <unk> the <unk> in cooks time after <unk> from the <unk> all the information which was needed we decided upon penetrating to the village and after a temporary sojourn there to strike the beach again and journey round to <unk> a harbour on the opposite side of the island we at once put ourselves in travelling trim just previous to leaving tahiti having found my wardrobe reduced to two <unk> frock and <unk> both much the worse for wear i had <unk> them together for mutual <unk> after a fashion peculiar to sailors <unk> a red frock upon a blue one and producing thereby a choice variety in the way of clothing this was the extent of my wardrobe nor was the doctor by any means better off his <unk> had at last driven him to don the nautical garb but by this time his <unk> light cotton <unk> almost given out and he had nothing to replace it <unk> very <unk> offered him one which was a little less ragged but the alms were proudly refused long ghost <unk> to assume the ancient costume of <unk> <unk> this garment once worn as a festival dress is now seldom met with but captain <unk> had often shown us one which he kept as an <unk> it was a cloak or mantle of yellow tappa precisely similar to the <unk> worn by the <unk> spaniards the head being slipped through a slit in the middle the robe hangs about the person in ample <unk> <unk> obtained sufficient coarse brown tappa to make a short mantle of this description and in five minutes the doctor was <unk> <unk> eyeing his <unk> critically reminded its proprietor that there were many streams to <unk> and <unk> to scale between <unk> and <unk> and if he <unk> in <unk> he had better hold them up besides other <unk> we were utterly <unk> in the free and easy pacific sailors seldom wear shoes mine had been tossed overboard the day we met the trades and except in one or two <unk> ashore i had never worn any since in <unk> they would have been desirable but none were to be had for the expedition we <unk> however they were indispensable <unk> being the owner of a pair of huge dilapidated boots hanging from a <unk> like <unk> the doctor succeeded in exchanging for them a <unk> the last valuable article in his possession for myself i made <unk> from a <unk> hide such as are worn by the indians in <unk> they are made in a minute the sole rudely fashioned to the foot being confined across the <unk> by three <unk> of leather our <unk> deserves a passing word my comrades was a brave old <unk> hat made of grass almost as fine as threads of silk and so elastic that upon rolling it up it sprang into perfect shape again set off by the <unk> <unk> of this spanish <unk> doctor long ghost in this and his <unk> looked like a <unk> <unk> nor was my own appearance in an eastern turban less distinguished the way i came to wear it was this my hat having been knocked overboard a few days before reaching <unk> i was obliged to mount an abominable wad of <unk> <unk> sailors call a scotch cap <unk> knows the <unk> of <unk> wool and this <unk> <unk> crowned my temples so effectually that the confined atmosphere <unk> was <unk> to my curls in vain i tried to <unk> the cap every gash made seemed to <unk> whole in no time then such a continual <unk> as it kept up in a hot sun seeing my <unk> to the thing <unk> my worthy friend prevailed upon me to bestow it upon him i did so hinting that a good boiling might restore the original <unk> of the colours it was then that i mounted the turban taking a new <unk> frock of the doctors which was of a gay calico and winding it round my head in folds i allowed the sleeves to <unk> <unk> forming a good <unk> against the sun though in a shower it was best off the <unk> sleeves adding much to the effect the doctor called me the <unk> with two tails thus arrayed we were ready for <unk> in whose green <unk> we counted upon creating no small sensation chapter <unk> <unk> long before sunrise the next morning my <unk> were laced on and the doctor had vaulted into <unk> boots <unk> to see us again before we went to <unk> the <unk> wished us a pleasant journey and on parting very <unk> presented us with a pound or two of what sailors call plug tobacco telling us to cut it up into small change the virginian weed being the principal <unk> <unk> on the island <unk> we were told was not more than three or four leagues distant so making allowances for a wild road a few hours to rest at noon and our determination to take the journey leisurely we counted upon reaching the shores of the lake some time in the flush of the evening for several hours we went on slowly through wood and ravine and over hill and precipice seeing nothing but occasional herds of wild cattle and often resting until we found ourselves about noon in the very heart of the island it was a green cool hollow among the mountains into which we at last descended with a bound the place was <unk> with a hundred springs and shaded over with great solemn trees on whose mossy <unk> the moisture stood in beads strange to say no traces of the <unk> ever having been here were revealed nor was there a sound to be heard nor a bird to be seen nor any breath of wind stirring the leaves the utter solitude and silence were <unk> and after peering about under the shades and seeing nothing but ranks of dark motionless trunks we hurried across the hollow and ascended a steep mountain opposite midway up we rested where the earth had gathered about the roots of three palms and thus formed a pleasant lounge from which we looked down upon the hollow now one dark green tuft of woodland at our feet here we brought forth a small calabash of <unk> a parting present from <unk> after eating heartily we obtained fire by two sticks and throwing ourselves back puffed forth our <unk> in wreaths of smoke at last we fell asleep nor did we <unk> till the sun had sunk so low that its rays darted in upon us under the foliage starting up we then continued our journey and as we gained the mountain <unk> to our surprise lay the lake and village of <unk> we had thought it a good league off where we stood the yellow sunset was still lingering but over the valley below long shadows were <unk> rippling green lake <unk> the houses and trees just as they stood along its banks several small canoes moored here and there to posts in the water were dancing upon the waves and one solitary fisherman was paddling over to a grassy point in front of the houses groups of natives were seen some thrown at full length upon the ground and others <unk> leaning against the bamboos with <unk> and <unk> we ran down the hills the <unk> soon hurrying forth to see who were coming as we drew near they gathered round all curiosity to know what brought the <unk> into their quiet country the doctor <unk> to make them understand the purely social object of our visit they gave us a true <unk> welcome pointing into their <unk> and saying they were ours as long as we chose to remain we were struck by the appearance of these people both men and women so much more <unk> than the inhabitants of the bays as for the young girls they were more retiring and modest more tidy in their dress and far <unk> and more beautiful than the damsels of the coast a thousand <unk> thought i that they should bury their charms in this nook of a valley that night we abode in the house of <unk> a hospitable old chief it was right on the shore of the lake and at supper we looked out through a rustling screen of foliage upon the surface of the <unk> water the next day we <unk> about and found a happy little community comparatively free from many deplorable evils to which the rest of their countrymen are subject their time too was more occupied to my surprise the manufacture of tappa was going on in several buildings european <unk> were seldom seen and not many articles of foreign origin of any description the people of <unk> were nominally christians but being so remote from <unk> <unk> their religion sat lightly upon them we had been told even that many heathenish games and <unk> still secretly lingered in their valley now the prospect of seeing an oldfashioned <unk> or <unk> reel was one of the <unk> which brought us here and so finding <unk> rather liberal in his religious ideas we disclosed our desire at first he <unk> and <unk> his shoulders like a frenchman declared it could not be brought <unk> a dangerous matter to attempt and might bring all concerned into trouble but we <unk> all this convinced him that the thing could be done and a <unk> a genuine pagan <unk> was arranged for that very night chapter <unk> a dance in the valley there were some <unk> <unk> seemed in <unk> and hence there was a deal of mystery about getting up the dance an hour or two before midnight <unk> entered the house and throwing robes of tappa over us bade us follow at a distance behind him and until out of the village <unk> our faces keenly alive to the adventure we obeyed at last after taking a wide circuit we came out upon the farthest shore of the lake it was a wide <unk> space lighted up by a full moon and <unk> with a minute species of <unk> growing closely together it swept right down to the water showing the village opposite glistening among the groves near the trees on one side of the clear space was a ruinous pile of stones many rods in extent upon which had formerly stood a temple of oro at present there was nothing but a rude hut planted on the lowermost <unk> it seemed to have been used as a tappa <unk> or house for making the native cloth here we saw lights gleaming from between the bamboos and casting long <unk> shadows upon the ground without voices also were heard we went up and had a peep at the <unk> who were getting ready for the <unk> they were some twenty in <unk> upon by hideous old <unk> who might have been <unk> long ghost proposed to send the latter <unk> but <unk> said it would never do and so they were permitted to remain we tried to effect an entrance at the door which was fastened but after a noisy discussion with one of the old <unk> within our guide became <unk> and at last told us to desist or we would spoil all he then led us off to a distance to await the performance as the girls he said did not wish to be recognized he furthermore made us promise to remain where we were until all was over and the <unk> had retired we waited impatiently and at last they came forth they were arrayed in short <unk> of white tappa with garlands of flowers on their heads following them were the <unk> who remained clustering about the house while the girls advanced a few paces and in an instant two of them taller than their companions were standing side by side in the middle of a ring formed by the clasped hands of the rest this movement was made in perfect silence presently the two girls join hands overhead and crying out <unk> <unk> wave them to and fro upon which the ring begins to circle slowly the <unk> moving sideways with their arms a little drooping soon they <unk> their pace and at last fly round and round bosoms heaving hair streaming flowers dropping and every sparkling eye circling in what seemed a line of light meanwhile the pair within are passing and <unk> each other incessantly <unk> sideways so that their long hair falls far over they glide this way and that one foot continually in the air and their fingers thrown forth and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> again cry the dance queens and coming together in the middle of the ring they once more lift up the arch and stand motionless <unk> <unk> every link of the circle is broken and the girls deeply breathing stand perfectly still they <unk> hard and fast a moment or two and then just as the deep flush is dying away from their faces slowly <unk> all round thus <unk> the ring again the two leaders wave their hands when the rest pause and now far apart stand in the still moonlight like a circle of <unk> presently raising a strange chant they softly sway themselves gradually <unk> the movement until at length for a few passionate moments with throbbing bosoms and glowing cheeks they abandon themselves to all the spirit of the dance apparently lost to everything around but soon subsiding again into the same languid measure as before they become motionless and then reeling forward on all sides their eyes swimming in their heads join in one wild chorus and sink into each others arms such is the <unk> i think they call it the dance of the <unk> girls of <unk> while it was going on we had as much as we could do to keep the doctor from rushing forward and seizing a <unk> they would give us no more <unk> that night and <unk> fairly dragged us away to a canoe hauled up on the lake shore when we reluctantly embarked and paddling over to the village arrived there in time for a good nap before sunrise the next day the doctor went about trying to hunt up the <unk> <unk> he thought to <unk> them by their late rising but never was man more mistaken for on first <unk> out the whole village was asleep waking up in concert about an hour after but in the course of the day he came across several whom he at once charged with taking part in the <unk> there were some <unk> fellows standing by visiting <unk> from <unk> perhaps and the girls looked <unk> but <unk> the charge most <unk> though soft as <unk> in general the ladies of <unk> are nevertheless <unk> with a slight <unk> of what we <unk> enough call the devil and they showed it on the present occasion for when the doctor pressed one rather hard she all at once turned round upon him and giving him a box on the ear told him to <unk> <unk> be off with himself chapter <unk> mysterious there was a little old man of a most hideous aspect living in <unk> who in a coarse mantle of tappa went about the village dancing and singing and making faces he followed us about wherever we went and when unobserved by others plucked at our garments making frightful signs for us to go along with him somewhere and see something it was in vain that we tried to get rid of him <unk> and <unk> even were at last <unk> to but though he howled like one possessed he would not go away but still haunted us at last we conjured the natives to rid us of him but they only laughed so we were forced to endure the <unk> as well as we could on the fourth night of our visit returning home late from paying a few calls through the village we turned a dark corner of trees and came full upon our <unk> friend as usual <unk> and <unk> with his hands the doctor <unk> a curse hurried forward but from some impulse or other i stood my ground resolved to find out what this unaccountable object wanted of us seeing me pause he crept close up to me peered into my face and then retreated <unk> me to follow which i did in a few moments the village was behind us and with my guide in advance i found myself in the shadow of the heights overlooking the farther side of the valley here my guide paused until i came up with him when side by side and without speaking we ascended the hill presently we came to a wretched hut barely <unk> in the shade cast by the neighbouring trees pushing aside a rude sliding door held together with <unk> the <unk> signed me to enter within it looked dark as pitch so i gave him to understand that he must strike a light and go in before me without <unk> he disappeared in the darkness and after groping about i heard two sticks rubbing together and directly saw a spark a native <unk> was then lighted and i stooped and entered it was a mere <unk> foul old mats and broken cocoanut shells and calabashes were strewn about the floor of earth and overhead i caught glimpses of the stars through <unk> in the roof here and there the thatch had fallen through and hung down in <unk> i now told him to set about what he was going to do or produce whatever he had to show without delay looking round <unk> as if <unk> a surprise he commenced turning over and over the <unk> in one corner at last he clutched a calabash stained black and with the neck broken off on one side of it was a large hole something seemed to be stuffed away in the vessel and after a deal of <unk> at the aperture a musty old pair of sailor <unk> was drawn forth and holding them up eagerly he inquired how many pieces of tobacco i would give for them without <unk> i hurried away the old man chasing me and shouting as i ran until i gained the village here i <unk> him and made my way home resolved never to <unk> so <unk> an adventure to no purpose the next morning my comrade besought me to enlighten him i preserved a mysterious silence the occurrence served me a good turn however so long as we abode in <unk> for the old <unk> never afterwards troubled me but forever haunted the doctor who in vain <unk> heaven to be delivered from him chapter <unk> the <unk> or flight i say doctor cried i a few days after my adventure with the <unk> as in the absence of our host we were one morning lounging upon the <unk> in his dwelling smoking our reed pipes <unk> a thriving place why not settle down faith said he not a bad idea paul but do you fancy theyll let us stay though why certainly they would be <unk> to have a couple of <unk> for <unk> <unk> youre right my pleasant fellow ha ha ill put up a <unk> as a physician from <unk> <unk> on polynesian <unk> english in five <unk> of one hour <unk> <unk> for the manufacture of <unk> out a public park in the middle of the village and found a festival in honour of captain cook but surely not without stopping to take breath observed i the doctors <unk> to be sure were of a rather <unk> cast but we seriously thought nevertheless of <unk> our stay in the valley for an indefinite period and with this understanding we were turning over various plans for spending our time pleasantly when several women came running into the house and hurriedly besought us to <unk> <unk> make our escape crying out something about the <unk> thinking that we were about to be taken up under the act for the <unk> of <unk> we flew out of the house sprang into a canoe before the door and paddled with might and main over to the opposite side of the lake approaching <unk> dwelling was a great crowd among which we perceived several natives who from their partly european dress we were certain did not reside in <unk> plunging into the groves we <unk> our stars that we had thus narrowly escaped being <unk> as runaway seamen and marched off to the beach this at least was what we thought we had escaped having fled the village we could not think of prowling about its vicinity and then returning in doing so we might be <unk> our liberty again we therefore determined upon journeying back to <unk> and setting our faces <unk> we reached the <unk> house about nightfall they gave us a cordial reception and a hearty supper and we sat up talking until a late hour we now prepared to go round to <unk> a place from which we were not far off when at <unk> but <unk> to see as much of the island as we could we preferred returning to <unk> and then going round by way of the beach <unk> the only <unk> harbour of <unk> lies on the western side of the island almost directly over against <unk> upon one shore of the bay stands the village of <unk> a missionary station in its vicinity is an extensive sugar <unk> best in the south seas <unk> by a person from <unk> the <unk> property of the husband of <unk> and every way a delightful retreat <unk> was one of the occasional <unk> of the court but at the time i write of it was permanently fixed there the queen having fled thither from tahiti <unk> they told us was by no means the place <unk> was ships seldom touched and very few foreigners were living ashore a solitary whaler however was reported to be lying in the harbour <unk> and <unk> and to be in want of men all things considered i could not help looking upon <unk> as offering a splendid opening for us adventurers to say nothing of the <unk> presented for going to sea in the whaler or <unk> ourselves out as day <unk> in the sugar plantation there were hopes to be entertained of being promoted to some office of high trust and <unk> about the person of her majesty the queen nor was this expectation altogether <unk> in the train of many polynesian princes roving whites are frequently found gentleman <unk> of state <unk> in the tropical sunshine of the court and leading the <unk> lives in the world upon islands little visited by foreigners the first seaman that <unk> down is generally <unk> in the family of the head chief or king where he frequently <unk> the functions of various offices elsewhere filled by as many different individuals as <unk> for instance he gives the natives some account of distant countries as <unk> of the arts and <unk> he <unk> them in the use of the jackknife and the best way of <unk> bits of iron <unk> into <unk> and as <unk> to his majesty he <unk> intercourse with strangers besides <unk> the people generally in the uses of the most common

<unk> of the tambourine joe a <unk> portuguese who lost his leg by a whale is <unk> and <unk> as he is called a <unk> <unk> going about with his cups and balls in a side pocket <unk> the court with his <unk> these idle rascals receive no fixed <unk> being altogether <unk> upon the casual bounty of their master now and then they run up a score at the dance houses in <unk> where the illustrious <unk> iii afterwards calls and <unk> the bill a few years since an auctioneer to his majesty came near being added to the <unk> of state it seems that he was the first man who had practised his vocation in the sandwich islands and delighted with the sport of bidding upon his <unk> the king was one of his best customers at last he besought the man to leave all and follow him and he should be <unk> provided for at court but the auctioneer refused and so the ivory hammer lost the chance of being borne before him on a velvet <unk> when the next king went to be crowned but it was not as strolling <unk> nor as <unk> out of employ that the doctor and myself looked forward to our approaching introduction to the court of the queen of tahiti on the contrary as before hinted we expected to swell the <unk> of breadfruit and cocoanuts on the civil list by filling some honourable office in her gift we were told that to resist the <unk> of the french the queen was rallying about her person all the foreigners she could her <unk> for the english and americans was well known and this was an additional ground for our <unk> a <unk> reception <unk> had informed us moreover that by the queens <unk> at <unk> a war of <unk> against the invaders of <unk> had been seriously thought of should this prove true a surgeons commission for the doctor and a <unk> for myself were certainly counted upon in our sanguine expectations such then were our views and such our hopes in projecting a trip to <unk> but in our most lofty aspirations we by no means lost sight of any minor matters which might help us to <unk> the doctor had informed me that he <unk> in playing the <unk> i now suggested that as soon as we arrived at <unk> we should endeavour to <unk> a <unk> for him or if this could not be done that he should manufacture some kind of a substitute and thus <unk> apply for an audience of the queen her wellknown passion for music would at once secure his <unk> and so under the most <unk> <unk> bring about our introduction to her notice and who knows said my <unk> comrade throwing his head back and performing an imaginary air by briskly drawing one arm across the other who knows that i may not <unk> myself into her majestys good <unk> so as to became a sort of <unk> to the <unk> <unk> chapter <unk> how we were to get to <unk> the <unk> circumstances of our somewhat premature departure from <unk> filled the sagacious doctor and myself with sundry misgivings for the future under <unk> protection we were secure from all <unk> interference in our concerns on the part of the natives but as <unk> <unk> over the island we ran the risk of being <unk> as <unk> and as such sent back to tahiti the truth is that the <unk> constantly offered for the apprehension of <unk> from ships induce some of the natives to eye all strangers <unk> a <unk> was therefore desirable but such a thing had never been heard of in <unk> at last long ghost suggested that as the yankee was well known and much respected all over the island we should endeavour to obtain from him some sort of paper not only <unk> to our having been in his employ but also to our not being <unk> <unk> nor yet runaway seamen even written in english a paper like this would answer every purpose for the <unk> natives standing in great awe of the document would not dare to molest us until acquainted with its <unk> then if it came to the worst we might repair to the nearest missionary and have the <unk> explained upon <unk> <unk> of these matters he seemed highly <unk> with the opinion we entertained of his reputation abroad and he agreed to <unk> us the doctor at once offered to furnish him with a draught of the paper but he refused saying he would write it himself with a <unk> <unk> therefore a bit of soiled paper and a stout heart he set to work evidently he was not accustomed to <unk> for his literary throes were so violent that the doctor suggested that some sort of a <unk> operation might be necessary the precious paper was at last finished and a great curiosity it was we were much diverted with his reasons for not <unk> it in this here <unk> <unk> he observed a <unk> cant keep the run of the months <unk> cause theres no seasons no summer and winter to go by ones <unk> <unk> its always july its so <unk> hot a <unk> provided we cast about for some means of getting to <unk> the island of <unk> is very nearly surrounded by a regular <unk> of coral extending within a mile or less of the shore the smooth canal within furnishes the best means of communication with the different settlements all of which with the exception of <unk> are right upon the water and so indolent are the <unk> that they think nothing of going twenty or thirty miles round the island in a canoe in order to reach a place not a quarter of that distance by land but as hinted before the fear of the <unk> has something to do with this the idea of journeying in a canoe struck our fancy quite pleasantly and we at once set about <unk> one if possible but none could we obtain for not only did we have nothing to pay for <unk> one but we could not expect to have it <unk> inasmuch as the goodnatured owner would in all probability have to walk along the beach as we paddled in order to bring back his property when we had no further use for it at last it was decided to commence our journey on foot trusting that we would soon fall in with a canoe going our way in which we might take passage the <unk> said we would find no beaten path all we had to do was to follow the beach and however inviting it might look inland on no account must we stray from it in short the longest way round was the nearest way to <unk> at intervals there were little <unk> along the shore besides lonely <unk> <unk> here and there where we could get plenty to eat without pay so there was no necessity to lay in any store <unk> to be off before sunrise the next morning so as to have the benefit of the <unk> part of the day we bade our kind hosts farewell <unk> and then repairing to the beach we launched our floating <unk> and slept away merrily till dawn chapter <unk> the journey round the beach it was on the fourth day of the first month of the <unk> or flight from <unk> we now reckoned our time thus that rising bright and early we were up and away out of the valley of <unk> before the fishermen even were stirring it was the earliest dawn the morning only showed itself along the lower edge of a bank of purple clouds pierced by the misty peaks of tahiti the tropical day seemed too languid to rise sometimes starting <unk> it <unk> the clouds with faint <unk> of <unk> and gray which <unk> away left all dim again anon it threw out thin pale rays growing lighter and lighter until at last the golden morning sprang out of the east with a <unk> its bright beams hither and thither higher and higher and sending them <unk> over the face of the heavens all balmy from the groves of tahiti came an indolent air cooled by its <unk> over the waters and grateful <unk> was the damp and slightly yielding beach from which the waves seemed just retired the doctor was in famous spirits removing his <unk> he went splashing into the sea and after swimming a few yards <unk> ashore <unk> <unk> and jumping along the beach but very careful to cut all his <unk> in the direction of our journey say what they will of the glowing independence one feels in the saddle give me the first morning flush of your cheery <unk> thus <unk> we went on as <unk> and carefree as we could wish and here i cannot refrain from <unk> the very superior <unk> which most <unk> countries afford not only to mere rovers like ourselves but to penniless people generally in these genial regions ones wants are naturally diminished and those which remain are easily <unk> fuel <unk> and if you please clothing may be entirely <unk> with how different our hard northern latitudes alas the lot of a poor devil twenty degrees north of the tropic of <unk> is indeed pitiable at last the beach contracted to hardly a yards width and the dense <unk> almost dipped into the sea in place of the smooth sand too we had sharp fragments of broken coral which made travelling exceedingly unpleasant lord my foot roared the doctor fetching it up for inspection with a <unk> fling of the limb a sharp <unk> had thrust itself into the flesh through a hole in his boot my <unk> were worse yet their <unk> taking a sort of fossil impression of everything trod upon turning round a bold sweep of the beach we came upon a piece of fine open ground with a <unk> dwelling in the distance crowning a <unk> which rolled off into the water the hut proved to be a low rude <unk> very recently thrown up for the bamboos were still green as grass and the <unk> fresh and fragrant as meadow hay it was open upon three sides so that upon drawing near the domestic arrangements within were in plain sight no one was stirring and nothing was to be seen but a clumsy old chest of native <unk> a few calabashes and bundles of tappa hanging against a post and a heap of something we knew not what in a dark corner upon close inspection the doctor discovered it to be a loving old couple locked in each others arms and rolled together in a tappa mantle halloa <unk> he cried shaking the one with a beard but <unk> heeded him not though <unk> a wrinkled old body started up in <unk> and yelled aloud neither of us <unk> to <unk> her she presently became quiet and after staring hard and asking some <unk> questions she proceeded to rouse her still slumbering mate what <unk> him we could not tell but there was no waking him equally in vain were all his dear <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> he lay like a log face up <unk> away like a cavalry <unk> here my good woman said long ghost just let me try and taking the patient right by his nose he so lifted him bodily into a sitting position and held him there until his eyes opened when this event came to pass <unk> looked round like one <unk> and then springing to his feet backed away into a corner from which place we became the objects of his earnest and respectful attention permit me my dear <unk> to introduce to you my esteemed friend and comrade paul said the doctor <unk> me up with all the <unk> and flourish imaginable upon this <unk> began to recover his faculties and surprised us not a little by talking a few words of english so far as could be understood they were expressive of his having been aware that there were two <unk> in the <unk> that he was glad to see us and would have something for us to eat in no time how he came by his english was explained to us before we left some time previous he had been a <unk> of <unk> where the native language is <unk> over with the most <unk> sailor phrases he seemed to be quite proud of his residence there and alluded to it in the same significant way in which a <unk> <unk> you that in his time he has resided in the capital the old fellow was disposed to be <unk> but being <unk> we told him to get breakfast after which we would hear his <unk> while employed among the calabashes the strange <unk> <unk> between these old <unk> was really amusing i made no doubt that they were saying to each other yes my <unk> my life just in the same way that some young <unk> do at home they gave us a hearty meal and while we were discussing its merits they assured us over and over again that they expected nothing in return for their <unk> more we were at liberty to stay as long as we pleased and as long as we did stay their house and everything they had was no longer theirs but ours still more they themselves were our <unk> old lady to a degree that was altogether superfluous this now is <unk> hospitality <unk> upon ones own hearthstone for the benefit of the guest the polynesians carry their hospitality to an amazing extent let a native of <unk> the <unk> part of tahiti make his appearance as a traveller at <unk> the most <unk> village of <unk> though a perfect stranger the inhabitants on all sides <unk> him at their <unk> inviting him to enter and make himself at home but the traveller passes on examining every house attentively until at last he <unk> before one which <unk> him and then exclaiming ah <unk> <unk> this one will do i think he steps in and makes himself perfectly at ease flinging himself upon the mats and very probably calling for a nice young cocoanut and a piece of <unk> breadfruit <unk> thin and done brown curious to relate however should a stranger carrying it thus bravely be afterwards discovered to be without a house of his own why he may thenceforth go <unk> for his <unk> the <unk> or white men are exceptions to this rule thus it is precisely as in civilized countries where those who have houses and lands are incessantly <unk> to death with <unk> to come and live in other peoples houses while many a poor gentleman who <unk> the seams of his coat and to whom the like invitation would be really <unk> may go and <unk> for it but to the credit of the ancient <unk> it should here be observed that this blemish upon their hospitality is only of recent origin and was wholly unknown in old times so told me captain <unk> in polynesia it is esteemed a great hit if a man succeed in <unk> into a family to which the best part of the community is related heaven knows it is otherwise with us the reason is that when he goes <unk> the greater number of houses are the more completely at his service receiving a paternal <unk> from old <unk> and <unk> we continued our journey resolved to stop at the very next place of <unk> which offered nor did we long stroll for it a fine walk along a beach of shells and we came to a spot where trees here and there the land was all meadow sloping away to the water which stirred a <unk> growth of <unk> <unk> its margin close by was a little <unk> walled in with coral where a fleet of canoes was dancing up and down a few paces distant on a natural <unk> overlooking the sea were several native <unk> newly thatched and peeping into view out of the foliage like <unk> as we drew near forth came a burst of voices and presently three gay girls <unk> with life health and youth and full of spirits and mischief one was arrayed in a <unk> robe of calico and her long black hair was braided behind in two immense tresses joined together at the ends and wreathed with the green tendrils of a vine from her selfpossessed and forward air i fancied she might be some young lady from <unk> on a visit to her country relations her companions wore mere <unk> of cotton cloth their hair was <unk> and though very pretty they betrayed the reserve and embarrassment characteristic of the provinces the little <unk> first mentioned ran up to me with great <unk> and giving the <unk> salutation opened upon me such a fire of questions that there was no understanding much less answering them but our hearty welcome to <unk> as she called the <unk> was made plain enough meanwhile doctor long ghost gallantly presented an arm to each of the other young ladies which at first they knew not what to make of but at last taking it for some kind of joke <unk> the civility the names of these three damsels were at once made known by themselves and being so exceedingly romantic i cannot forbear <unk> them upon my comrades arms then were hanging night and morning in the persons of <unk> or the <unk> and <unk> or the <unk> she with the tresses was very <unk> styled <unk> the wakeful or <unk> by this time the houses were emptied of the rest of their <unk> few old men and women and several <unk> young fellows rubbing their eyes and yawning all crowded round putting questions as to whence we came upon being informed of our acquaintance with <unk> they were delighted and one of them recognized the boots worn by the doctor <unk> <unk> <unk> they cried nuee nuee <unk> <unk> <unk> plenty of potatoes there was now a little friendly <unk> as to who should have the honour of entertaining the strangers at last a tall old gentleman by name <unk> with a bald head and white beard took us each by the hand and led us into his dwelling once inside <unk> pointing about with his staff was so <unk> in assuring us that his house was ours that long ghost suggested he might as well hand over the deed it was drawing near noon so after a light lunch of roasted breadfruit a few <unk> of a pipe and some lively chatting our host admonished the company to lie down and take the everlasting <unk> we complied and had a social nap all round chapter <unk> a <unk> in <unk> it was just in the middle of the merry mellow afternoon that they <unk> us to dinner underneath a green shelter of palm boughs open all round and so low at the eaves that we stooped to enter within the ground was strewn over with aromatic <unk> <unk> gathered which stirred <unk> diffused the sweetest <unk> on one side was a row of yellow mats <unk> with fibres of bark stained a bright red here seated after the fashion of the turk we looked out over a verdant bank upon the mild blue endless pacific so far round had we <unk> the island that the view of tahiti was now <unk> upon the ferns before us were laid several layers of broad thick <unk> leaves <unk> over one upon the other and upon these were placed side by side <unk> banana leaves at least two yards in length and very wide the <unk> were withdrawn so as to make them lie flat this green cloth was set out and garnished in the manner following first a number of <unk> leaves by way of plates were ranged along on one side and by each was a rustic <unk> <unk> with seawater and a <unk> roll or small breadfruit roasted brown an immense flat calabash placed in the centre was heaped up with numberless small packages of moist <unk> leaves in each was a small fish baked in the earth and done to a turn this pyramid of a dish was <unk> on either side by an <unk> calabash one was brimming with the <unk> <unk> or pudding made from the red <unk> of the mountains the other was stacked up with cakes of the indian <unk> previously <unk> in a mortar <unk> with the milk of the cocoanut and then baked in the spaces between the three <unk> were piled young cocoanuts stripped of their <unk> their eyes had been opened and enlarged so that each was a <unk> goblet there was a sort of <unk> in one corner upon which in bright <unk> jackets lay the <unk> of bananas <unk> <unk> <unk> with the shadows of their crimson <unk> <unk> through a transparent skin and almost coming and going there like <unk> <unk> <unk> here and there <unk> and great jolly <unk> which rolled about in very <unk> such a heap all ruddy ripe and <unk> with the good cheer of the tropical soil from which they sprang a land of orchards cried the doctor in a rapture and he snatched a morsel from a sort of fruit of which gentlemen of the sanguine <unk> are remarkably fond namely the ripe <unk> lips of <unk> <unk> who stood looking on <unk> allotted seats to his guests and the meal began thinking that his hospitality needed some <unk> i rose and pledged him in the vegetable wine of the cocoanut merely repeating the ordinary salutation <unk> <unk> <unk> sensible that some compliment after the fashion of white men was paid him with a smile and a courteous flourish of the hand he bade me be seated no people however refined are more easy and graceful in their manners than the <unk> the doctor sitting next our host now came under his special protection laying before his guest one of the packages of fish <unk> opened it and <unk> its contents to his particular regards but my comrade was one of those who on convivial occasions can always take care of themselves he ate an indefinite number of <unk> lee lees small fish his own and next <unk> breadfruit and helped himself to right and left with all the ease of an accomplished <unk> paul said he at last you dont seem to be getting along why dont you try the <unk> <unk> and by way of example he steeped a morsel of food into his <unk> of seawater on following suit i found it quite <unk> though rather bitter but on the whole a capital substitute for salt the <unk> invariably use seawater in this way deeming it quite a treat and considering that their country is surrounded by an ocean of <unk> the luxury cannot be deemed an <unk> one the fish were delicious the manner of cooking them in the ground preserving all the <unk> and rendering them exceedingly sweet and tender the <unk> pudding was almost <unk> the cakes of indian <unk> quite <unk> and the roasted breadfruit crisp as toast during the meal a native lad walked round and round the party carrying a long staff of bamboo this he occasionally <unk> upon the cloth before each guest when a white <unk> substance dropped forth with a <unk> not unlike that of a <unk> this proved to be <unk> an excellent relish prepared from the grated meat of ripe cocoanuts <unk> with cocoanut milk and salt water and kept perfectly tight until a little past the <unk> stage of <unk> throughout the repast there was much lively chatting among the islanders in which their <unk> powers quite exceeded ours the young ladies too showed themselves very expert in the use of their tongues and contributed much to the <unk> which prevailed nor did these lively nymphs suffer the meal to <unk> for upon the doctors throwing himself back with an air of much satisfaction they sprang to their feet and <unk> him with <unk> and <unk> this at last put an end to the entertainment by a hundred <unk> <unk> my long friend became a great favourite with these people and they bestowed upon him a long comical title expressive of his lank figure and <unk> combined the latter by the <unk> never failed to excite the remark of everybody we encountered the giving of <unk> is quite a passion with the people of tahiti and <unk> no one with any peculiarity whether of person or temper is exempt not even strangers a <unk> captain of a manofwar visiting tahiti for the second time discovered that among the natives he went by the dignified title of <unk> <unk> <unk> head or pudding head nor is the highest rank among themselves any protection the first husband of the present queen was commonly known in the court circles as <unk> belly he carried the greater part of his person before him to be sure and so did the gentlemanly george <unk> what a title for a king consort even <unk> itself the royal <unk> was originally a mere <unk> and literally signifies one talking through his nose the first monarch of that name being on a war party and sleeping <unk> among the mountains <unk> one morning with a cold in his head and some wag of a <unk> had no more manners than to <unk> him thus how different from the <unk> polynesian in this as in all other respects is our grave and decorous north american indian while the former <unk> a name in accordance with some humorous or ignoble trait the latter <unk> upon what is deemed the most exalted or warlike and hence among the red tribes we have the truly <unk> <unk> of white eagles young oaks fiery eyes and <unk> bows chapter <unk> the <unk> while the doctor and the natives were taking a <unk> nap after dinner i strolled forth to have a peep at the country which could produce so generous a meal to my surprise a fine strip of land in the vicinity of the <unk> and <unk> seaward by a grove of cocoanut and breadfruit trees was under high <unk> sweet potatoes indian <unk> and yams were growing also <unk> a few <unk> and other fruits still more pleasing was the sight of young breadfruit and cocoanut trees set out with great care as if for once the <unk> polynesian had thought of his posterity but this was the only instance of native <unk> which ever came under my observation for in all my <unk> over tahiti and <unk> nothing so much struck me as the comparative <unk> of these trees in many places where they ought to abound entire valleys like <unk> of <unk> <unk> are abandoned to all the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the sea and <unk> by streams from the mountains are overgrown with a wild <unk> <unk> introduced by foreigners and which spreads with such fatal rapidity that the natives standing still while it grows anticipate its covering the entire island even <unk> of clear land which with so little pains might be made to wave with orchards lie wholly neglected when i considered their <unk> soil and climate thus unaccountably <unk> i often turned in amazement upon the natives about <unk> some of whom all but starve in their gardens run to waste upon other islands which i have visited of similar <unk> and wholly <unk> from their <unk> condition no spectacle of this sort was presented the high estimation in which many of their <unk> are held by the <unk> and <unk> beauty in the <unk> manifold uses and the facility with which they are <unk> are considerations which render the <unk> alluded to still more unaccountable the <unk> is as an example a tree by far the most important <unk> of nature in the tropics to the polynesians it is emphatically the tree of life <unk> even the breadfruit in the <unk> uses to which it is applied its very aspect is imposing <unk> its supremacy by an erect and lofty bearing it may be said to compare with other trees as man with inferior creatures the blessings it <unk> are <unk> tear after year the islander <unk> beneath its shade both eating and drinking of its fruit he <unk> his hut with its boughs and <unk> them into baskets to carry his food he <unk> himself with a fan <unk> from the young leaflets and shields his head from the sun by a bonnet of the leaves sometimes he clothes himself with the <unk> substance which <unk> round the base of the <unk> whose elastic rods strung with <unk> are used as a <unk> the larger nuts <unk> and polished furnish him with a beautiful goblet the smaller ones with <unk> for his pipes the dry <unk> kindle his fires their fibres are twisted into <unk> and cords for his canoes he <unk> his wounds with a <unk> <unk> from the juice of the nut and with the oil extracted from its meat <unk> the bodies of the dead the noble trunk itself is far from being <unk> <unk> into posts it <unk> the islanders dwelling converted into charcoal it cooks his food and supported on blocks of stone <unk> in his lands he <unk> his canoe through the water with a paddle of the wood and goes to battle with clubs and spears of the same hard material in pagan tahiti a cocoanut branch was the symbol of regal authority laid upon the sacrifice in the temple it made the offering sacred and with it the priests <unk> and put to flight the evil spirits which assailed them the supreme majesty of oro the great god of their <unk> was declared in the cocoanut log from which his image was rudely carved upon one of the <unk> islands there stands a living tree <unk> itself as a deity even upon the sandwich islands the <unk> <unk> all its ancient reputation the people there having thought of <unk> it as the national <unk> the cocoanut is planted as follows selecting a suitable place you drop into the ground a fully ripe nut and leave it in a few days a thin <unk> shoot forces itself through a minute hole in the shell <unk> the <unk> and soon <unk> three <unk> leaves in the air while <unk> in the same soft white <unk> which now completely <unk> the nut a pair of <unk> roots pushing away the <unk> which close two holes in an opposite direction penetrate the shell and strike vertically into the ground a day or two more and the shell and <unk> which in the last and <unk> stage of the nut are so hard that a knife will scarcely make any impression <unk> burst by some force within and henceforth the hardy young plant <unk> <unk> and <unk> no <unk> <unk> or attention of any sort rapidly advances to maturity in four or five years it bears in twice as many more it begins to lift its head among the groves where <unk> strong it <unk> for near a century thus as some voyager has said the man who but drops one of these nuts into the ground may be said to <unk> a greater and more certain benefit upon himself and posterity than many a lifes toil in less genial climes the <unk> of the tree is remarkable as long as it lives it bears and without <unk> two hundred nuts besides innumerable white blossoms of others may be seen upon it at one time and though a whole year is required to bring any one of them to the <unk> point no two perhaps are at one time in precisely the same stage of growth the tree delights in a maritime situation in its greatest perfection it is perhaps found right on the <unk> where its roots are actually washed but such instances are only met with upon islands where the swell of the sea is prevented from breaking on the beach by an <unk> reef no <unk> flavour is perceptible in the nut produced in such a place although it bears in any soil whether upland or bottom it does not flourish vigorously inland and i have frequently observed that when met with far up the valley its tall stem <unk> seaward as if <unk> after a more genial region it is a curious fact that if you <unk> the cocoanut tree of the verdant tuft at its head it dies at once and if allowed to stand thus the trunk which when alive is <unk> in so hard a bark as to be almost <unk> to a bullet <unk> away and in an <unk> short period becomes dust this is perhaps partly owing to the peculiar constitution of the trunk a mere <unk> of minute hollow <unk> closely packed and very hard but when exposed at top peculiarly fitted to convey moisture and decay through the entire stem the finest orchard of <unk> i know and the only plantation of them i ever saw at the islands is one that stands right upon the southern shore of <unk> bay they were set out by the first <unk> almost half a century ago and the soil being especially adapted to their growth the noble trees now form a magnificent grove nearly a mile in extent no other plant scarcely a bush is to be seen within its precincts the <unk> road passes through its entire length at noonday this grove is one of the most beautiful serene <unk> places that ever was seen high overhead are ranges of green rustling arches through which the suns rays come down to you in sparkles you seem to be wandering through <unk> halls of pillars everywhere you catch glimpses of stately <unk> <unk> each other at all points a strange silence too reigns far and near the air flushed with the mellow stillness of a sunset but after the long morning calms the <unk> comes in and creeping over the tops of these thousand trees they nod their plumes soon the breeze <unk> and you hear the branches brushing against each other and the flexible trunks begin to sway toward evening the whole grove is rocking to and fro and the traveller on the <unk> road is startled by the frequent falling of the nuts snapped from their <unk> <unk> they come flying through the air ringing like <unk> balls and often bound along the ground for many rods chapter <unk> life at <unk> finding the society at <unk> very pleasant the young ladies in particular being extremely sociable and moreover in love with the famous good cheer of old <unk> we acquiesced in an invitation of his to tarry a few days longer we might then he said join a small canoe party which was going to a place a league or two distant so averse to all exertion are these people that they really thought the prospect of thus getting rid of a few miles walking would prevail with us even if there were no other inducement the people of the <unk> as we soon discovered formed a snug little community of <unk> of which our host seemed the head <unk> in truth was a petty chief who owned the neighbouring lands and as the wealthy in most cases rejoice in a numerous kindred the family footing upon which everybody visited him was perhaps <unk> to the fact of his being the lord of the <unk> like captain <unk> he was in some things a gentleman of the old <unk> <unk> for the customs of a past and pagan age nowhere else except in <unk> did we find the manners of the natives less <unk> by recent <unk> the oldfashioned <unk> dinner they gave us on the day of our arrival was a fair <unk> of their general mode of living our time passed <unk> the doctor went his way and i mine with a pleasant companion he was forever strolling inland <unk> to <unk> <unk> specimens while i for the most part kept near the sea sometimes taking the girls on an <unk> <unk> in a canoe often we went fishing not dozing over stupid hooks and lines but leaping right into the water and chasing our prey over the coral rocks spear in hand <unk> fish is glorious sport the <unk> all round the island catch them in no other way the smooth <unk> between the reef and the shore and at low water the reef itself being <unk> adapted to this mode of <unk> them at almost any time of the <unk> ever the sacred hour of <unk> may see the <unk> pursuing their sport with loud <unk> <unk> their spears and splashing through the water in all directions sometimes a solitary native is seen far out upon a lonely shallow <unk> slowly along with eye intent and poised spear but the best sport of all is going out upon the great reef itself by <unk> the natives follow this <unk> with as much spirit as a gentleman of england does the chase and take full as much delight in it the torch is nothing more than a bunch of dry <unk> bound firmly together the spear a long light pole with an iron head on one side barbed i shall never forget the night that old <unk> and the rest of us paddling off to the reef leaped at midnight upon the coral ledges with waving <unk> and spears we were more than a mile from the land the sullen ocean thundering upon the outside of the rocks dashed the spray in our faces almost <unk> the <unk> and far as the eye could reach the darkness of sky and water was <unk> with a long misty line of foam marking the course of the coral barrier the wild fishermen flourishing their weapons and yelling like so many <unk> to <unk> their prey sprang from ledge to ledge and sometimes darted their spears in the very midst of the breakers but <unk> was not the only sport we had at <unk> right on the beach was a mighty old cocoanut tree the roots of which had been <unk> by the waves so that the trunk inclined far over its base from the tuft of the tree a stout cord of bark depended the end of which swept the water several yards from the shore this was a <unk> swing a native lad <unk> hold of the cord and after swinging to and fro quite leisurely all at once sends himself fifty or sixty feet from the water rushing through the air like a <unk> i doubt whether any of our <unk> would attempt the feat for my own part i had neither head nor heart for it so after sending a lad aloft with an additional cord by way of security i constructed a large basket of green boughs in which i and some particular friends of mine used to swing over sea and land by the hour chapter <unk> we start for <unk> bright was the morning and <unk> still the smiles of the young ladies who accompanied us when we sprang into a sort of family <unk> and <unk> bade adieu to the hospitable <unk> and his <unk> as we paddled away they stood upon the beach waving their hands and crying out <unk> <unk> farewell farewell as long as we were within hearing very sad at parting with them we endeavoured nevertheless to <unk> ourselves in the society of our <unk> among these were two old ladies but as they said nothing to us we will say nothing about them nor anything about the old men who managed the canoe but of the three mischievous <unk> young <unk> who lounged in the stern of that comfortable old island <unk> i have a great deal to say in the first place one of them was <unk> the <unk> and in the second place neither she nor the <unk> her companions ever dreamed of taking the voyage until the doctor and myself announced our intention their going along was nothing more than a <unk> frolic in short they were a parcel of wicked <unk> bent on mischief who laughed in your face when you looked sentimental and only <unk> your company when making merry at your expense something or other about us was perpetually <unk> their mirth <unk> this to his own remarkable figure the doctor increased their enjoyment by assuming the part of a merry <unk> yet his cap and bells never <unk> but to some tune and while playing the <unk> i more than suspected that he was trying to play the <unk> at home it is deemed <unk> to go <unk> in epaulets but among the polynesians your best dress in <unk> is <unk> a fresh breeze springing up we set our sail of <unk> and glided along as tranquilly as if floating upon an inland stream the white reef on one hand and the green shore on the other soon as we turned a headland we encountered another canoe paddling with might and main in an opposite direction the strangers shouting to each other and a tall fellow in the bow dancing up and down like a crazy man they shot by us like an arrow though our <unk> shouted again and again for them to cease paddling according to the natives this was a kind of royal <unk> carrying a message from the queen to her friends in a distant part of the island passing several shady bowers which looked quite inviting we proposed touching and <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> by a stroll ashore so forcing our canoe among the bushes behind a decayed palm lying partly in the water we left the old folks to take a nap in the shade and <unk> the others among the trees which were here <unk> with vines and creeping <unk> in the early part of the afternoon we drew near the place to which the party were going it was a solitary house inhabited by four or five old women who when we entered were gathered in a circle about the mats eating <unk> from a cracked calabash they seemed delighted at seeing our companions but rather drew up when introduced to ourselves eyeing us <unk> they whispered to know who we were the answers they received were not satisfactory for they treated us with marked coolness and reserve and seemed desirous of breaking off our acquaintance with the girls unwilling therefore to stay where our company was disagreeable we resolved to depart without even eating a meal informed of this <unk> and her companions evinced the most lively concern and equally unmindful of their former spirits and the remonstrances of the old ladies broke forth into <unk> and lamentations which were not to be <unk> we agreed therefore to tarry until they left for home which would be at the <unk> or falling of the sun in other words at sunset when the hour arrived after much <unk> we saw them safely embarked as the canoe turned a bluff they seized the paddles from the hands of the old men and waved them silently in the air this was meant for a touching farewell as the paddle is only waved thus when the parties <unk> never more expect to meet we now continued our journey and following the beach soon came to a level and lofty overhanging bank which planted here and there with trees took a broad sweep round a considerable part of the island a fine <unk> <unk> the edge of the bank and often we paused to admire the scenery the evening was still and fair even for so heavenly a climate and all round as far as the eye could reach was the blending blue sky and ocean as we went on the <unk> still accompanied us turning as we turned and thundering its distant bass upon the ear like the unbroken roar of a cataract dashing forever against their coral <unk> the breakers looked in the distance like a line of rearing white <unk> <unk> in tossing their white <unk> and <unk> with foam these great natural <unk> are <unk> <unk> for the protection of the land nearly all the society islands are <unk> by them were the vast swells of the pacific to break against the soft <unk> <unk> which in many places border the sea the soil would soon be washed away and the natives be thus deprived of their most <unk> lands as it is the banks of no <unk> are <unk> but the coral <unk> answer another purpose they form all the <unk> of this group including the twentyfour round about the shores of tahiti curiously enough the <unk> in the reefs by which alone vessels enter to their anchorage are invariably opposite the mouths of running streams an advantage fully <unk> by the mariner who touches for the purpose of <unk> his ship it is said that the fresh water of the land mixing with the <unk> held in <unk> by the sea so acts upon the latter as to resist the formation of the coral and hence the breaks here and there these <unk> are <unk> as it were by little fairy islets green as <unk> and waving with palms strangely and <unk> <unk> the long line of breakers no objects can strike the fancy more vividly <unk> ii with a taste in <unk> truly <unk> selected one of them as a royal retreat we passed it on our journey omitting several further adventures which befell us after leaving the party from <unk> we must now hurry on to relate what happened just before reaching the place of our destination chapter <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> it must have been at least the tenth day reckoning from the <unk> that we found ourselves the guests of <unk> an old hermit of an islander who kept house by himself perhaps a couple of leagues from <unk> a <unk> from the beach there was a fantastic rock <unk> and deep in a dell it was <unk> by a shallow brook which dividing its waters flowed on both sides until united below twisting its roots round the rock a <unk> <unk> spread itself overhead in a wilderness of foliage the elastic <unk> <unk> from the larger boughs <unk> themselves into every cleft thus forming <unk> to the parent stem in some places these <unk> branches <unk> had not yet reached the rock swinging their loose <unk> ends in the air like <unk> <unk> hut a mere <unk> of bamboos was perched upon a level part of the rock the ridgepole resting at one end in a crotch of the <unk> and the other <unk> by a forked bough planted in a <unk> notwithstanding our cries as we drew near the first hint the old hermit received of our approach was the doctors stepping up and touching his shoulder as he was kneeling over on a stone <unk> fish in the brook he leaped up and stared at us but with a variety of uncouth gestures he soon made us welcome <unk> us by the same means that he was both deaf and dumb he then motioned us into his dwelling going in we threw ourselves upon an old mat and peered round the soiled bamboos and calabashes looked so <unk> that the doctor was for pushing on to <unk> that night notwithstanding it was near sunset but at length we concluded to stay where we were after a good deal of <unk> outside under a <unk> shed the old man made his appearance with our supper in one hand he held a <unk> <unk> and in the other a huge flat calabash <unk> filled with viands his eyes were dancing in his head and he looked from the calabash to us and from us to the calabash as much as to say ah my lads what do ye think of this eh pretty good cheer eh but the fish and indian <unk> being none of the best we made but a sorry meal while discussing it the old man tried hard to make himself understood by signs most of which were so <unk> <unk> that we made no doubt he was <unk> a series of <unk> jokes the <unk> of the feast removed our host left us for a moment returning with a calabash of portly dimensions and furnished with a long hooked neck the mouth of which was stopped with a wooden plug it was covered with particles of earth and looked as if just taken from some place <unk> with sundry <unk> and horrible <unk> peculiar to the dumb the vegetable <unk> was now <unk> the old fellow looking round cautiously and pointing at it as much as to intimate that it contained something which was taboo or forbidden aware that <unk> <unk> were strictly prohibited to the natives we now watched our <unk> with much interest charging a cocoanut shell he tossed it off and then filling up again presented the goblet to me <unk> the smell i made faces at it upon which he became highly excited so much so that a miracle was wrought upon the spot snatching the cup from my hands he shouted out ah <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> arva <unk> <unk> in other words what a <unk> of a white man this is the real stuff we could not have been more startled had a <unk> leaped from his mouth for an instant he looked confused enough himself and then placing a finger mysteriously upon his mouth he contrived to make us understand that at times he was subject to a suspension of the powers of speech deeming the phenomenon a remarkable one every way the doctor desired him to open his mouth so that he might have a look down but he refused this occurrence made us rather suspicious of our host nor could we afterward account for his conduct except by supposing that his <unk> <unk> might in some way or other assist him in the <unk> pursuits in which it afterwards turned out that he was engaged this conclusion however was not altogether satisfactory to <unk> him we at last took a sip of his arva <unk> and found it very <unk> and strong as <unk> curious to know whence it was obtained we questioned him when lighting up with pleasure he seized the <unk> and led us outside the hut bidding us follow after going some distance through the woods we came to a dismantled old shed of boughs apparently abandoned to decay underneath nothing was to be seen but heaps of <unk> leaves and an immense clumsy jar <unk> and by some means rudely <unk> out from a ponderous stone here for a while we were left to ourselves the old man placing the light in the jar and then <unk> he returned carrying a long large bamboo and a <unk> stick throwing these down he <unk> under a pile of <unk> and brought out a rough block of wood pierced through and through with a hole which was immediately clapped on the top of the jar then planting the <unk> stick upright about two yards distant and making it sustain one end of the bamboo he inserted the other end of the latter into the hole in the block concluding these arrangements by placing an old calabash under the farther end of the bamboo coming up to us now with a sly significant look and pointing <unk> at his <unk> he exclaimed ah <unk> <unk> <unk> arva <unk> as much as to say this you see is the way its done his contrivance was nothing less than a native still where he <unk> his island <unk> the <unk> in which we found it was probably <unk> as a security against detection before we left the shed the old fellow <unk> the whole concern over and dragged it away <unk> his <unk> his secret to us thus was characteristic of the <unk> <unk> or <unk> of the missionaries among the natives who presuming that all foreigners are opposed to the <unk> of the missionaries take pleasure in making them <unk> whenever the <unk> of their rulers are secretly set at <unk> the substance from which the liquor is produced is called <unk> which is a large <unk> root something like <unk> but smaller in its green state it is exceedingly <unk> but boiled or baked has the sweetness of the <unk> after being subjected to the fire <unk> and reduced to a certain stage of <unk> the <unk> is stirred up with water and is then ready for <unk> on returning to the hut pipes were introduced and after a while long ghost who at first had <unk> the arva <unk> as little as myself to my surprise began to wax sociable over it with <unk> and before long absolutely got mellow the old <unk> keeping him company it was a curious sight <unk> knows that so long as the occasion <unk> there is no stronger bond of sympathy and good feeling among men than getting <unk> together and how earnestly nay <unk> a brace of worthies thus employed will endeavour to shed light upon and <unk> their mystical ideas fancy <unk> and the doctor then <unk> <unk> and brimming over with a desire to become better acquainted the doctor politely bent upon carrying on the conversation in the language of his host and the old hermit <unk> in trying to talk english the result was that between the two they made such a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that it was enough to turn ones brain the next morning on waking i heard a voice from the tombs it was the doctor solemnly pronouncing himself a dead man he was sitting up with both hands clasped over his forehead and his pale face a thousand times <unk> than ever that infernal stuff has murdered me he cried heavens my heads all wheels and springs like the <unk> <unk> whats to be done paul im poisoned but after drinking a <unk> draught <unk> by our host and eating a light meal at noon he felt much better so much so that he declared himself ready to continue our journey when we came to start the yankees boots were missing and after a diligent search were not to be found enraged beyond measure their proprietor said that <unk> must have stolen them but considering his hospitality i thought this extremely improbable though to whom else to impute the theft i knew not the doctor maintained however that one who was capable of <unk> an innocent traveller with arva <unk> was capable of anything but it was in vain that he stormed and <unk> and i searched the boots were gone were it not for this mysterious occurrence and <unk> <unk> <unk> i would here <unk> all travellers going round by the beach to <unk> to stop at the rock and <unk> the old <unk> more especially as he <unk> <unk> chapter <unk> our reception in <unk> upon starting at last i flung away my <unk> this time quite worn <unk> the view of keeping company with the doctor now forced to go <unk> recovering his spirits in good time he protested that boots were a bore after all and going without them <unk> manly this was said be it observed while strolling along over a soft carpet of grass a little moist even at midday from the shade of the wood through which we were passing emerging from this we entered upon a blank <unk> tract upon which the suns rays fairly flashed making the loose <unk> under foot well nigh as hot as the floor of an oven such yelling and leaping as there was in getting over this ground would be hard to surpass we could not have crossed at <unk> toward <unk> it not been for a few small <unk> bushes growing here and there into which we every now and then thrust our feet to cool there was no little judgment necessary in selecting your bush for if not chosen <unk> the chances were that on springing forward again and finding the next bush so far off that an <unk> <unk> was indispensable you would have to run <unk> to your old place again safely passing the <unk> or fiery desert we soothed our <unk> feet by a pleasant walk through a meadow of long grass which soon brought us in sight of a few straggling houses sheltered by a grove on the <unk> of the village of <unk> my comrade was for entering the first one we came to but on drawing near they had so much of an air of <unk> at least for native <unk> that i <unk> thinking they might be the <unk> of the higher chiefs from whom no very extravagant welcome was to be anticipated while standing <unk> a voice from the nearest house hailed us <unk> <unk> <unk> come in come in strangers we at once entered and were warmly greeted the master of the house was an <unk> islander dressed in loose linen drawers a fine white shirt and a <unk> of red silk tied about the waist after the fashion of the spaniards in chili he came up to us with a free frank air and striking his chest with his hand introduced himself as <unk> <unk> or to render the christian name back again into <unk> <unk> these curious <unk> of names among the people of the society islands <unk> in the following way when a native is <unk> his <unk> often gives offence to the missionaries and they <unk> upon changing to something else whatever is <unk> therein so when <unk> came to the <unk> and gave his name as <unk> <unk> something equivalent to <unk> the reverend gentleman <unk> told him that such a heathenish appellation would never do and a substitute must be had at least for the devil part of it some highly respectable christian <unk> were then submitted from which the <unk> for admission into the church was at liberty to choose there was <unk> adam <unk> noah <unk> <unk> <unk> james <unk> john <unk> peter <unk> <unk> etc and thus did he come to be named <unk> <unk> or <unk> he certainly was i fancy as to the <unk> of his new <unk> we gave our names in return upon which he bade us be seated and sitting down himself asked us a great many questions in mixed english and <unk> after giving some directions to an old man to prepare food our hosts wife a large <unk> woman upwards of forty also sat down by us in our soiled and <unk> appearance the good lady seemed to find abundant matter for <unk> and all the while kept looking at us <unk> and making mournful exclamations but <unk> and his spouse were not the only inmates of the mansion in one corner upon a large native couch elevated upon posts reclined a <unk> who <unk> in her own long hair had yet to make her toilet for the day she was the daughter of <unk> and a very beautiful little daughter she was not more than fourteen with the most delightful <unk> a bud just blown and large <unk> eyes they called her <unk> a name rather pretty and genteel and therefore quite appropriate for a more genteel and <unk> little damsel there was not in all <unk> she was a cold and haughty young beauty though this same little <unk> and never <unk> to notice us further than now and then to let her eyes float over our persons with an expression of indolent indifference with the tears of the <unk> girls hardly dry from their sobbing upon our shoulders this <unk> treatment <unk> us not a little when we first entered <unk> was raking smooth the carpet of dried ferns which had that morning been newly laid and now that our meal was ready it was spread on a banana leaf right upon this fragrant floor here we lounged at our ease eating baked pig and breadfruit off <unk> plates and using for the first time in many a long month real knives and forks these as well as other symptoms of refinement somewhat abated our surprise at the reserve of the little <unk> her <unk> doubtless were <unk> in <unk> and she herself was an <unk> after being informed of our stay in the vale of <unk> they were very curious to know on what errand we came to <unk> we merely hinted that the ship lying in the harbour was the reason of our coming <unk> <unk> wife was a right <unk> body the meal over she recommended a nap and upon our waking much refreshed she led us to the <unk> and pointed down among the trees through which we saw the gleam of water taking the hint we repaired thither and finding a deep shaded pool bathed and returned to the house our <unk> now sat down by us and after looking with great interest at the doctors cloak felt of my own soiled and tattered garments for the <unk> time and exclaimed <unk> nuee nuee <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alas they are very very old very old when <unk> good soul thus addressed us she thought she was talking very respectable english the word nuee is so familiar to foreigners throughout polynesia and is so often used by them in their intercourse with the natives that the latter suppose it to be common to all mankind <unk> <unk> is the native <unk> of old man which by society islanders talking <unk> is applied indiscriminately to all aged things and persons whatsoever going to a chest filled with various european articles she took out two <unk> of new sailor frocks and <unk> and presenting them with a gracious smile pushed us behind a calico screen and left us without any fastidious scruples we <unk> the garments and what with the meal the nap and the bath we now came forth like a couple of <unk> evening drawing on lamps were lighted they were very simple the half of a green <unk> about one third full of cocoanut oil and a <unk> of twisted tappa floating on the surface as a night lamp this contrivance cannot be <unk> a soft dreamy light being shed through the transparent rind as the evening advanced other members of the household whom as yet we had not seen began to drop in there was a slender young dandy in a gay <unk> shirt and whole fathoms of bright <unk> calico tucked about his waist and falling to the ground he wore a new straw hat also with three distinct ribbons tied about the crown one black one green and one <unk> shoes or stockings however he had none there were a couple of delicate <unk> little <unk> mild eyes and beautiful hair who ran about the house <unk> like a couple of <unk> they had a brother somewhat <unk> fine dark boy with an eye like a womans all these were the children of <unk> <unk> in lawful wedlock then there were two or three <unk> old ladies who wore shabby <unk> of soiled <unk> which fitted so <unk> and withal had such a <unk> look that i at once put their <unk> down as domestic <unk> relations supported by the bounty of my lady <unk> they were sad meek old bodies said little and ate less and either kept their eyes on the ground or lifted them up deferentially the <unk> of the island must have had something to do with making them what they were i had almost forgotten <unk> the grinning old man who prepared our meal his head was a shining bald globe he had a round little <unk> and legs like a cat he was <unk> <unk> butler and <unk> of the breadfruit and cocoanut trees and added to all else a mighty favourite with his <unk> with whom he would sit smoking and <unk> by the hour often you saw the indefatigable <unk> working away at a great rate then dropping his employment all at <unk> mind <unk> off to a little distance and after rolling himself away in a corner and taking a nap jump up again and fall to with fresh <unk> from a certain something in the behaviour of <unk> and his household i was led to believe that he was a pillar of the church though from what i had seen in tahiti i could hardly <unk> such a supposition with his frank cordial <unk> air but i was not wrong in my conjecture <unk> turned out to be a sort of <unk> or deacon he was also accounted a man of wealth and was nearly related to a high chief before retiring the entire household gathered upon the floor and in their midst he read aloud a chapter from a <unk> bible then kneeling with the rest of us he offered up a prayer upon its conclusion all separated without speaking these devotions took place regularly every night and morning grace too was invariably said by this family both before and after eating after becoming <unk> with the almost utter <unk> of anything like practical piety upon these islands what i observed in our hosts house astonished me much but whatever others might have been <unk> was in truth a christian the only one <unk> <unk> whom i personally knew to be such among all the natives of polynesia chapter <unk> retiring for the <unk> doctor grows devout they put us to bed very pleasantly lying across the foot of <unk> <unk> couch was a smaller one made of <unk> a thin strong cord twisted from the fibres of the <unk> of the cocoanut and woven into an exceedingly light sort of <unk> forming its elastic body spread upon this was a single fine mat with a roll of dried ferns for a pillow and a strip of white tappa for a sheet this couch was mine the doctor was provided for in another corner <unk> reposed alone on a little <unk> with a <unk> burning by her side the dandy her brother swinging overhead in a sailors hammock the two <unk> <unk> upon a mat near by and the <unk> relations borrowed a <unk> corner of the old <unk> <unk> who <unk> away by the open door after all had retired <unk> placed the illuminated <unk> in the middle of the apartment and so we all <unk> till morning upon <unk> the sun was streaming <unk> through the open bamboos but no one was stirring after surveying the fine attitudes into which <unk> had thrown at least one of the sleepers my attention was called off to the general aspect of the dwelling which was quite significant of the superior circumstances of our host the house itself was built in the simple but tasteful native style it was a long regular oval some fifty feet in length with low sides of <unk> and a roof thatched with <unk> the ridgepole was perhaps twenty feet from the ground there was no foundation whatever the bare earth being merely covered with ferns a kind of <unk> which serves very well if frequently renewed otherwise it becomes dusty and the haunt of <unk> as in the <unk> of the <unk> natives besides the <unk> the furniture consisted of three or four sailor chests in which were stored the fine <unk> of the <unk> <unk> linen shirts of <unk> the calico <unk> of his wife and children and divers odds and ends of european <unk> of beads ribbons dutch <unk> knives coarse <unk> bunches of keys bits of <unk> and metal buttons one of these <unk> as a <unk> by <unk> several of the native hats <unk> all of the same pattern but <unk> with <unk> ribbons of nothing was our good <unk> more proud than of these hats and her <unk> on <unk> she went abroad a dozen times and every time like queen <unk> in a different robe <unk> for some reason or other always gave us our meals before the rest of the family were served and the doctor who was very <unk> in such matters declared that we fared much better than they certain it was that had <unk> guests <unk> with <unk> <unk> and letters of introduction to the queen they could not have been better cared for the day after our arrival <unk> the old butler brought us in for dinner a small pig baked in the ground all <unk> it lay in a wooden trencher surrounded by roasted <unk> of the breadfruit a large calabash filled with <unk> pudding or <unk> followed and the young dandy <unk> his customary languor threw down our cocoanuts from an adjoining tree when all was ready and the household looking on long ghost <unk> <unk> his hands over the fated pig <unk> a blessing hereupon everybody present looked exceedingly pleased <unk> coming up and addressing the doctor with much warmth and <unk> regarding him with almost maternal affection exclaimed <unk> ah <unk> <unk> <unk> in other words what a pious young man it was just after this meal that she brought me a roll of grass <unk> of the kind which sailors <unk> into the frame of their <unk> and then handing me needle and thread bade me begin at once and make myself the hat which i so much needed an accomplished hand at the business i finished it that <unk> <unk> the <unk> together and <unk> by way of <unk> my industry with her own olive hands <unk> the crown with a band of <unk> ribbon the two long ends of which streaming behind <unk> still preserved for me the eastern title bestowed by long ghost chapter <unk> a <unk> through the settlement the following morning making our <unk> carefully we <unk> our <unk> and sallied out on a tour without meaning to reveal our designs upon the court our principal object was to learn what chances there were for white men to obtain employment under the queen on this head it is true we had questioned <unk> but his answers had been very <unk> so we determined to obtain further information elsewhere but first to give some little description of the village the settlement of <unk> is nothing more than some eighty houses scattered here and there in the midst of an immense grove where the trees have been <unk> out and the <unk> cleared away through the grove flows a stream and the principal <unk> crosses it over an elastic bridge of cocoanut trunks laid together side by side the <unk> is broad and <unk> well shaded from one end to the other and as pretty a place for a morning promenade as any <unk> could wish the houses constructed without the slightest regard to the road peep into view from among the trees on either side some looking you right in the face as you pass and others without any manners turning their backs occasionally you observe a rural retreat inclosed by a picket of bamboos or with a solitary <unk> of glass <unk> <unk> in the broadside of the dwelling or with a rude <unk> door swinging upon <unk> wooden <unk> otherwise the <unk> are built in the original style of the natives and never mind how mean and <unk> some of them may appear within they all look picturesque enough without as we sauntered along the people we met saluted us pleasantly and invited us into their houses and in this way we made a good many brief morning calls but the hour could not have been the <unk> one in <unk> since the ladies were invariably in <unk> but they always gave us a cordial reception and were particularly polite to the doctor <unk> him and <unk> hanging about his neck wonderfully taken up in short with a gay handkerchief he wore there <unk> had that morning bestowed it upon the pious youth with some exceptions the general appearance of the natives of <unk> was far better than that of the inhabitants of <unk> a circumstance only to be imputed to their restricted intercourse with foreigners strolling on we turned a sweep of the road when the doctor gave a start and no wonder right before us in the grove was a block of houses regular square <unk> boarded over furnished with windows and <unk> and two stories high we ran up and found them fast going to decay very <unk> and here and there covered with moss no <unk> no doors and on one side the entire block had settled down nearly a foot on going into the <unk> we looked clean up through the <unk> timbers to the roof where rays of light <unk> through many a <unk> illuminated the <unk> which swung all round the whole interior was dark and close <unk> among some old mats in one corner like a parcel of <unk> in a ruin were a few vagabond natives they had their dwelling here curious to know who on earth could have been thus trying to improve the value of real estate in <unk> we made inquiries and learned that some years previous the block had been thrown up by a <unk> yankee one might have known that a <unk> by trade and a bold <unk> fellow by nature put ashore from his ship sick he first went to work and got well then sallied out with chisel and plane and made himself generally useful a sober steady man it seems he at last obtained the confidence of several chiefs and soon filled them with all sorts of ideas concerning the alarming want of public spirit in the people of <unk> more especially did he dwell upon the <unk> fact of their living in paltry <unk> of bamboo when magnificent palaces of boards might so easily be <unk> together in the end these <unk> so far prevailed with one old chief that the carpenter was engaged to build a <unk> of these wonderful palaces provided with plenty of men he at once set to work built a <unk> among the mountains <unk> trees and sent over to <unk> for nails <unk> the castle rose but alas the roof was hardly on when the yankees patron having <unk> beyond his means broke all to pieces and was absolutely unable to pay one plug of tobacco in the pound his failure involved the carpenter who sailed away from his <unk> in the very next ship that touched at the harbour the natives <unk> the <unk> palace of boards and often lounged by <unk> their heads and <unk> we were told that the queens residence was at the extreme end of the village so without waiting for the doctor to procure a <unk> we suddenly resolved upon going thither at once and learning whether any <unk> <unk> were vacant now although there was a good deal of my <unk> comrades nonsense about what has been said concerning our expectations of court <unk> we nevertheless really thought that something to our advantage might turn up in that quarter on approaching the palace grounds we found them rather peculiar a broad <unk> of <unk> coral rocks was built right out into the water and upon this and extending into a grove adjoining were some eight or ten very large native houses constructed in the <unk> style and inclosed together by a low picket of bamboos which embraced a considerable area throughout the society islands the <unk> of the chiefs are mostly found in the immediate vicinity of the sea a site which gives them the full benefit of a <unk> breeze nor are they so liable to the <unk> of insects besides enjoying when they please the fine shade afforded by the neighbouring groves always most <unk> near the water lounging about the grounds were some sixty or eighty <unk> natives men and women some reclining on the shady side of the houses others under the trees and a small group conversing close by the railing facing us we went up to the latter and giving the usual salutation were on the point of <unk> over the bamboos when they turned upon us <unk> and said we could not enter we stated our earnest desire to see the queen hinting that we were <unk> of important <unk> but it was to no purpose and not a little vexed we were obliged to return to <unk> without <unk> anything chapter <unk> an island <unk> visit the ship upon arriving home we fully laid open to <unk> our motives in visiting <unk> and begged his friendly advice in his broken english he cheerfully gave us all the information we needed it was true he said that the queen entertained some idea of making a stand against the french and it was <unk> reported also that several chiefs from <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the leeward islands of the group were at that very time taking counsel with her as to the <unk> of <unk> a general movement throughout the entire cluster with a view of <unk> any further <unk> on the part of the invaders should warlike measures be actually decided upon it was quite certain that <unk> would be glad to enlist all the foreigners she could but as to her making officers of either the doctor or me that was out of the question because already a number of europeans well known to her had volunteered as such concerning our getting immediate <unk> to the queen <unk> told us it was rather <unk> she living at that time very retired in poor health and spirits and averse to receiving calls previous to her misfortunes however no one however humble was denied <unk> to her presence sailors even attended her <unk> not at all <unk> by these things we concluded to kill time in <unk> until some event turned up more <unk> to our <unk> so that very day we sallied out on an <unk> to the ship which lying <unk> far up the bay yet remained to be visited passing on our route a long low shed a voice hailed <unk> men ahoy turning round who should we see but a <unk> englishman you could tell his country at a glance up to his knees in shavings and <unk> away at a bench he turned out to be a runaway ships carpenter recently from tahiti and now doing a <unk> business in <unk> by <unk> up the <unk> of <unk> chiefs with <unk> and other <unk> and once in a while trying his hand at a ladys <unk> he had been in the settlement but a few months and already possessed houses and lands but though blessed with prosperity and high health there was one thing <unk> wife and when he came to speak of the matter his countenance fell and he leaned <unk> upon his plane its too bad he sighed to wait three long years and all the while dear little <unk> living in the same house with that infernal chief from <unk> our curiosity was <unk> the poor carpenter then had been falling in love with some island <unk> who was going to <unk> him but such was not the case there was a law <unk> under a heavy penalty the marriage of a native with a <unk> unless the latter after being three years a <unk> on the island was willing to affirm his settled intention of remaining for life william was therefore in a sad way he told us that he might have married the girl <unk> times had it not been for this odious law but <unk> she had become less loving and more giddy particularly with the strangers from <unk> desperately smitten and desirous of securing her at all hazards he had proposed to the damsels friends a nice little arrangement introductory to marriage but they would not hear of it besides if the pair were discovered living together upon such a footing they would be liable to a <unk> <unk> to work making stone walls and opening roads for the queen doctor long ghost was all sympathy bill my good fellow said he <unk> let me go and talk to her but bill <unk> the offer would not even inform us where his <unk> lived leaving the <unk> <unk> <unk> a plank of new zealand pine an <unk> from the bay of islands and thinking the while of <unk> we went on our way how his suit <unk> in the end we never learned going from <unk> house toward the anchorage of the harbour of <unk> you catch no glimpse of the water until coming out from deep groves you all at once find yourself upon the beach a bay considered by many voyagers the most beautiful in the south seas then lies before you you stand upon one side of what seems a deep green river flowing through mountain passes to the sea right opposite a majestic promontory <unk> the <unk> from another called after its <unk> captain cook the face of this promontory toward <unk> is one verdant wall and at its base the waters lie still and fathomless on the left hand you just catch a peep of the <unk> mouth of the bay the break in the reef by which ships enter and beyond the sea to the right the <unk> sweeping boldly round the promontory runs far away into the land where save in one direction the hills close in on every side <unk> in verdure and shooting aloft in grotesque peaks the open space lies at the head of the bay in the distance it <unk> into a broad hazy plain lying at the foot of an <unk> of hills here is the large sugar plantation previously alluded to beyond the first range of hills you <unk> the sharp <unk> of the interior and among these the same silent <unk> which we so often admired from the other side of the island all alone in the harbour lay the good ship leviathan we jumped into the canoe and paddled off to her though early in the afternoon everything was quiet but upon mounting the side we found four or five sailors lounging about the forecastle under an <unk> they gave us no very cordial reception and though otherwise quite hearty in appearance seemed to assume a look of <unk> on purpose to honour our arrival there was much eagerness to learn whether we wanted to ship and by the unpleasant accounts they gave of the vessel they seemed desirous to prevent such a thing if possible we asked where the rest of the ships company were a <unk> old fellow made answer one boats crew of em is gone to <unk> <unk> <unk> off after a whale last cruise and never come back <unk> all the starboard watch ran away last night and the <unk> ashore <unk> em and its shipping <unk> after my jewels is it cried a <unk> little <unk> sailor coming up to us thin <unk> my <unk> <unk> be after sailing ashore in a <unk> <unk> of a skipper will carry <unk> both to sea whether or no be off <unk> ye thin <unk> and steer clear of the likes of this <unk> of <unk> as long as ye live they <unk> us here every day and starve us into the <unk> here dick lad <unk> the poor <unk> <unk> alongside and paddle away <unk> <unk> for dear life but we <unk> awhile listening to more <unk> to ship and at last concluded to stay to supper my <unk> never cut into better <unk> than that which we found lying in the <unk> in the forecastle the bread too was hard dry and <unk> as glass and there was plenty of both while we were below the mate of the vessel called out for <unk> to come on deck i liked his voice hearing it was as good as a look at his face it betokened a true sailor and no <unk> the appearance of the leviathan herself was quite pleasing like all large comfortable old whalers she had a sort of <unk> <unk> in the beam flush decks and four <unk> boats hanging at the breast her sails were furled loosely upon the yards as if they had been worn long and fitted easy her shrouds swung <unk> slack and as for the running rigging it never worked hard as it does in some of your dandy ships <unk> in the <unk> of blocks like chinese <unk> too small to be useful on the contrary the ropes ran <unk> through as if they had many a time <unk> the same road and were used to it when evening came we dropped into our canoe and paddled ashore fully convinced that the good ship never deserved the name which they gave her chapter <unk> a party of <unk> <unk> and the doctor while in <unk> we fell in with a band of six veteran rovers prowling about the village and harbour who had just come <unk> from another part of the island a few weeks previous they had been paid off at <unk> from a whaling vessel on board of which they had six months before shipped for a single cruise that is to say to be discharged at the next port their cruise was a famous one and each man stepped upon the beach at tahiti jingling his dollars in a <unk> weary at last of the shore and having some money left they <unk> and purchased a <unk> proposing a visit to a certain uninhabited island concerning which they had heard strange and golden stories of course they never could think of going to sea without a <unk> filled with flasks of spirits and a small cask of the same in the hold in case the chest should give out away they sailed hoisted a flag of their own and gave three times three as they staggered out of the bay of <unk> with a strong breeze and under all the <unk> they could carry evening coming on and feeling in high spirits and no ways disposed to sleep they concluded to make a night of it which they did all hands getting <unk> and the two masts going over the side about midnight to the tune of sailing down sailing down on the coast of <unk> fortunately one worthy could stand by holding on to the tiller and the rest managed to crawl about and <unk> away the <unk> of the rigging so as to break clear from the fallen spars while thus employed two sailors got tranquilly over the side and went <unk> to the bottom under the <unk> impression that they were stepping upon an imaginary wharf to get at their work better after this it blew quite a gale and the commodore at the helm instinctively kept the boat before the wind and by so doing ran over for the opposite island of <unk> crossing the channel by almost a miracle they went straight through an opening in the reef and shot upon a ledge of coral where the waters were tolerably smooth here they lay until morning when the natives came off to them in their canoes by the help of the islanders the schooner was <unk> over on her <unk> when finding the bottom knocked to pieces the adventurers sold the boat for a <unk> to the chief of the district and went ashore rolling before them their precious cask of spirits its contents soon <unk> and they came to <unk> the day after encountering these fellows we were strolling among the groves in the <unk> when we came across several parties of natives armed with clumsy muskets rusty cutlasses and outlandish clubs they were beating the bushes shouting aloud and apparently trying to <unk> somebody they were in pursuit of the strangers who having in a single night set at <unk> all the laws of the place had thought best to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> house was as pleasant a lounge as one could wish so after strolling about and seeing all there was to be seen we spent the greater part of our mornings there <unk> late and dining about two hours after noon sometimes we lounged on the floor of ferns smoking and telling stories of which the doctor had as many as a <unk> captain in the army sometimes we <unk> as well as we could with the natives and one <unk> to <unk> brought in three volumes of <unk> <unk> which had been found in the chest of a sailor who some time previous had died on the island <unk> hero of <unk> count <unk> a <unk> do we owe you i know not whether it was the reading of these <unk> or the want of some sentimental pastime which led the doctor about this period to lay <unk> to the heart of the little <unk> now as i have said before the daughter of <unk> was most <unk> reserved and never <unk> to notice us frequently i addressed her with a long face and an air of the profoundest and most distant <unk> in vain she wouldnt even turn up her pretty olive nose ah its quite plain thought i she knows very well what <unk> dogs sailors are and wont have anything to do with us but thus thought not my comrade bent he was upon firing the cold <unk> of <unk> <unk> eyes he opened the <unk> with admirable <unk> making cautious <unk> and content for three days with <unk> the <unk> for about five minutes after every meal on the fourth day he asked her a question on the fifth she dropped a nut of <unk> and he picked it up and gave it to her on the sixth he went over and sat down within three yards of the couch where she lay and on the memorable morn of the seventh he proceeded to open his batteries in form the damsel was reclining on the ferns one hand supporting her cheek and the other <unk> turning over the leaves of a <unk> bible the doctor approached now the chief <unk> under which he <unk> was his almost complete ignorance of the love <unk> of the island but french <unk> they say make love <unk> in broken english and what <unk> the doctor from doing the same in <unk> <unk> so at it he went ah said he smiling <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ready <unk> no answer not even a look ah i <unk> very <unk> ready <unk> <unk> <unk> without stirring began reading in a low tone to herself <unk> <unk> ready <unk> <unk> once more observed the doctor ingeniously <unk> his words for the third time but all to no purpose <unk> gave no sign he paused <unk> but it would never do to give up so he threw himself at full length beside her and <unk> commenced turning over the leaves <unk> gave a start just one little start barely perceptible and then fumbling something in her hand lay perfectly motionless the doctor rather frightened at his own <unk> and knowing not what to do next at last he placed one arm cautiously about her waist almost in the same instant he bounded to his feet with a cry the little witch had pierced him with a <unk> but there she lay just as quietly as ever turning over the leaves and reading to herself my long friend raised the <unk> <unk> and made a <unk> retreat to the place where i reclined looking on i am pretty sure that <unk> must have related this occurrence to her father who came in shortly afterward for he looked <unk> at the doctor but he said nothing and in ten minutes was quite as <unk> as ever as for <unk> there was not the slightest change in her and the doctor of course for ever afterwards held his peace chapter <unk> mrs bell one day taking a pensive afternoon stroll along one of the many <unk> which wind among the shady groves in the <unk> of <unk> i was startled by a sunny apparition it was that of a beautiful young <unk> <unk> dressed and mounted upon a spirited little white <unk> switching a green branch she came <unk> toward me i looked round to see whether i could possibly be in polynesia there were the palmtrees but how to account for the lady stepping to one side as the apparition drew near i made a polite <unk> it gave me a bold rosy look and then with a gay air <unk> its <unk> crying out fly away <unk> and <unk> among the trees i would have followed but <unk> heels were making such a <unk> among the dry leaves that pursuit would have been useless so i went straight home to <unk> and related my adventure to the doctor the next day our inquiries resulted in finding out that the stranger had been on the island about two years that she came from <unk> and was the wife of mr bell happy dog the proprietor of the sugar plantation to which i have previously referred to the sugar plantation we went the same day the country round about was very beautiful a level basin of verdure surrounded by sloping hillsides the <unk> which there was about one hundred acres in various stages of <unk> <unk> a considerable tract of land however which seemed to have been formerly <unk> was now abandoned the place where they extracted the <unk> matter was under an immense shed of bamboos here we saw several clumsy pieces of <unk> for breaking the cane also great <unk> for boiling the sugar but at present nothing was going on two or three natives were lounging in one of the <unk> smoking the other was occupied by three sailors from the leviathan playing cards while we were conversing with these worthies a stranger approached he was a <unk> <unk> european dressed in a loose suit of <unk> his fine throat and chest were exposed and he sported a <unk> hat with a brim like a chinese umbrella this was mr bell he was very civil showed us the grounds and taking us into a sort of <unk> to our surprise offered to treat us to some wine people often do the like but mr bell did more he produced the bottle it was spicy <unk> and we drank out of the <unk> of fresh <unk> <unk> <unk> goblets the wine was a purchase from the french in tahiti now all this was extremely polite in mr bell still we came to see mrs bell but she proved to be a phantom indeed having left the same morning for <unk> on a visit to one of the missionaries wives there i went home much <unk> to be frank my curiosity had been wonderfully <unk> concerning the lady in the first place she was the most beautiful white woman i ever saw in polynesia but this is saying nothing she had such eyes such <unk> in her cheeks such a divine air in the saddle that to my dying day i shall never forget mrs bell the <unk> himself was young robust and handsome so merrily may the little bells increase and multiply and make music in the land of <unk> chapter <unk> <unk> <unk> court in polynesia in <unk> is to be seen one of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the south seas like the buildings of the palace it stands upon an artificial <unk> presenting a semicircular sweep to the bay the chapel is built of <unk> blocks of coral a substance which although extremely <unk> is said to <unk> by exposure to the atmosphere to a stranger these blocks look extremely curious their surface is covered with strange <unk> impressions the seal of which must have been set before the flood very nearly white when <unk> from the reefs the coral <unk> with age so that several churches in polynesia now look almost as sooty and venerable as famed st pauls in shape the chapel is an <unk> with galleries all round it will seat perhaps four hundred people everything within is stained a tawny red and there being but few windows or rather <unk> the dusky <unk> and galleries and the tall <unk> of a pulpit look anything but cheerful on <unk> we always went to worship here going in the family <unk> of <unk> we of course maintained a most decorous exterior and hence by all the elderly people of the village were doubtless regarded as pattern young men <unk> seat was in a snug corner and it being particularly snug in the immediate vicinity of one of the palm pillars supporting the gallery i invariably leaned against it <unk> and his lady on one side the doctor and the dandy on the other and the children and poor relations seated behind as for <unk> instead of sitting as she ought to have done by her good father and mother she must needs run up into the gallery and sit with a parcel of giddy creatures of her own age who all through the sermon did nothing but look down on the congregation pointing out and <unk> at the <unk> old ladies in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> herself was never guilty of these <unk> occasionally during the week they have afternoon service in the chapel when the natives themselves have something to say although their auditors are but few an introductory prayer being offered by the missionary and a <unk> sung <unk> rise in their places and <unk> in pure <unk> and with wonderful tone and gesture and among them all deacon <unk> though he talked most was the one whom you would have liked best to hear much would i have given to have understood some of his <unk> bursts when he tossed his arms overhead stamped <unk> and <unk> till he looked like the very angel of vengeance <unk> man sighed the doctor on one of these occasions i fear he takes the <unk> view of the subject one thing was certain when <unk> spoke all listened a great deal more than could be said for the rest for under the discipline of two or three i could mention some of the audience <unk> others <unk> a few yawned and one irritable old gentleman in a <unk> of cocoanut leaves used to clutch his long staff in a state of excessive nervousness and <unk> out of the church making all the noise he could to <unk> his disgust right adjoining the chapel is an immense <unk> building with windows and <unk> and a <unk> board <unk> laid upon trunks of palmtrees they called it a <unk> but as such we never saw it occupied it was often used as a <unk> however and here we attended several <unk> among others that of a decayed naval officer and a young girl of fourteen the latter charged with having been very <unk> on a particular occasion set forth in the <unk> and the former with having aided and <unk> her in her <unk> and with other <unk> the <unk> was a tall <unk> fellow with a dark cheek and black whiskers according to his own account he had lost a <unk> armed brig on the coast of new zealand and since then had been leading the life of a man about town among the islands of the pacific the doctor wanted to know why he did not go home and report the loss of his brig but captain crash as they called him had some incomprehensible reasons for not doing so about which he could talk by the hour and no one be any the wiser probably he was a discreet man and thought it best to waive an interview with the lords of the <unk> for some time past this extremely suspicious character had been carrying on the <unk> trade in french wines and <unk> smuggled over from the menofwar lately touching at tahiti in a grove near the anchorage he had a rustic <unk> and <unk> where in quiet times when no ships were in <unk> a stray native once in a while got <unk> and staggered home catching at the cocoanut trees as he went the captain himself lounged under a tree during the warm <unk> pipe in mouth thinking perhaps over old times and occasionally feeling his shoulders for his lost epaulets but sail ho a ship is descried coming into the bay soon she drops her anchor in its waters and the next day captain crash <unk> the sailors in his grove and rare times they have of <unk> and <unk> together as sociably as you please upon one of these occasions the crew of the leviathan made so prodigious a tumult that the natives indignant at the insult offered their laws plucked up a heart and made a dash at the <unk> one hundred strong the sailors fought like tigers but were at last overcome and carried before a native tribunal which after a mighty <unk> dismissed everybody but captain crash who was asserted to be the author of the <unk> upon this charge then he had been placed in confinement against the coming on of the <unk> the judge being expected to lounge along in the course of the afternoon while waiting his honours arrival numerous additional offences were preferred against the culprit mostly by the old women among others was the bit of a slip in which he stood <unk> along with the young lady thus in polynesia as <unk> a man with one <unk> and all his <unk> are <unk> up and <unk> before him going to the <unk> for the purpose of witnessing the trial the din of it assailed our ears a long way off and upon entering the building we were almost stunned about five hundred natives were present each apparently having something to say and determined to say it his <unk> handsome <unk> old <unk> crosslegged on a little platform seemingly resigned with all christian submission to the uproar he was an hereditary chief in this quarter of the island and judge for life in the district of <unk> there were several cases coming on but the captain and girl were first tried together they were mixing freely with the crowd and as it afterwards turned out that <unk> matter <unk> a right to address the court for aught we knew they might have been <unk> their own case at what precise moment the trial began it would be hard to say there was no swearing of witnesses and no regular <unk> now and then somebody leaped up and shouted out something which might have been evidence the rest meanwhile keeping up an incessant <unk> presently the old judge himself began to get excited and springing to his feet ran in among the crowd <unk> his tongue as hard as anybody the tumult lasted about twenty minutes and toward the end of it captain crash might have been seen tranquilly regarding from his honours platform the judicial uproar in which his fate was about being decided the result of all this was that both he and the girl were found guilty the latter was <unk> to make six mats for the queen and the former in consideration of his manifold offences being deemed <unk> was <unk> to eternal <unk> from the island both these <unk> seemed to <unk> in the general <unk> his honour however appeared to have considerable authority and it was quite plain that the decision received his <unk> the above <unk> were by no means indiscriminately inflicted the missionaries have prepared a sort of penal <unk> to <unk> judicial proceedings it <unk> so many days <unk> on the <unk> road to indulge in the pleasures of the calabash so many fathoms of stone wall to steal a musket and so on to the end of the catalogue the judge being provided with a book in which all these matters are cunningly arranged the thing is vastly convenient for instance a crime is <unk> <unk> turn to letter band there you have it <unk> days on the <unk> road and twenty mats for the queen read the passage aloud and sentence is pronounced after taking part in the first trial the other <unk> present were put upon their own in which also the <unk> culprits seemed to have quite as much to say as the rest a rather strange proceeding but strictly in accordance with the glorious english principle that every man should be tried by his peers they were all found guilty chapter <unk> queen <unk> it is well to learn something about people before being introduced to them and so we will here give some account of <unk> and her family every reader of cooks voyages must remember <unk> who in that <unk> time was king of the larger <unk> of tahiti subsequently assisted by the muskets of the <unk> men he extended his rule over the entire island this <unk> before his death had his name changed into <unk> which has ever since been the royal <unk> he was succeeded by his son <unk> ii the most famous prince in the <unk> of tahiti though a sad <unk> and <unk> and even charged with unnatural crimes he was a great friend of the missionaries and one of their very first <unk> during the religious wars into which he was hurried by his zeal for the new faith he was <unk> and <unk> from the island after a short exile he returned from <unk> with an army of eight hundred warriors and in the battle of <unk> routed the rebellious pagans with great slaughter and <unk> himself upon the throne thus by force of arms was christianity finally triumphant in tahiti <unk> ii dying in <unk> was succeeded by his infant son under the title of <unk> iii this young prince survived his father but six years and the government then descended to his <unk> sister <unk> the present queen who is commonly called <unk> <unk> i or the first female <unk> her majesty must be now upwards of thirty years of age she has been twice married her first husband was a son of the old king of <unk> an island about one hundred miles from tahiti this proving an unhappy alliance the pair were soon afterwards <unk> the present husband of the queen is a chief of <unk> the reputation of <unk> is not what it ought to be she and also her mother were for a long time <unk> members of the church and the former i believe still is among other things her <unk> fidelity is far from being <unk> indeed it was upon this ground chiefly that she was <unk> from the <unk> of the church previous to her misfortunes she spent the greater portion of her time sailing about from one island to another attended by a <unk> court and wherever she went all manner of games and <unk> celebrated her arrival she was always given to display for several years the <unk> of a regiment of household troops drew largely upon the royal <unk> they were <unk> fellows in a uniform of calico shirts and <unk> hats armed with muskets of all shapes and <unk> and commanded by a great noisy chief <unk> it in a coat of fiery red these heroes escorted their <unk> whenever she went abroad some time ago the queen received from her english sister <unk> a very <unk> though uneasy <unk> crown probably made to order at some <unk> in london having no idea of <unk> so pretty a <unk> for coronation days which come so seldom her majesty sported it whenever she appeared in public and to show her familiarity with european customs politely touched it to all foreigners of <unk> captains and the <unk> she happened to meet in her evening walk on the <unk> road the arrival and departure of royalty were always announced at the palace by the court <unk> fat old gentleman who in a prodigious hurry and perspiration discharged minute <unk> as fast as he could load and fire the same the <unk> <unk> leads her husband a hard life poor fellow he not only caught a queen but a tartar when he married her the style by which he is addressed is rather <unk> <unk> man all things considered as appropriate a title for a <unk> as could be hit upon if ever there were a <unk> husband that man is the prince one day his <unk> giving audience to a <unk> from the captains of the vessels lying in <unk> he ventured to make a suggestion which was very <unk> to her she turned round and <unk> his ears told him to go over to his beggarly island of <unk> if he wanted to give himself airs <unk> and <unk> poor <unk> flies to the bottle or rather to the calabash for solace like his wife and <unk> he <unk> more than he ought six or seven years ago when an american manofwar was lying at <unk> the town was thrown into the greatest commotion by a <unk> assault and battery made upon the sacred person of <unk> by her intoxicated <unk> captain <unk> once told me the story and by way of throwing more spirit into the description as well as to make up for his <unk> <unk> the old man went through the accompanying action myself being <unk> for the queen of tahiti it seems that on a sunday morning being dismissed <unk> from the royal presence <unk> was accosted by certain good fellows friends and boon companions who <unk> with him on his <unk> against the queen and finally dragged him away to an <unk> <unk> of spirits in whose house the party got <unk> mellow in this state <unk> <unk> i was the topic upon which all <unk> <unk> of a queen probably suggested one its <unk> said another and id have satisfaction cried a third and so i <unk> must have <unk> for off he went and <unk> that his royal half was out <unk> he mounted his horse and <unk> after her near the <unk> of the town a <unk> of women came <unk> toward him in the centre of which was the object of his fury smiting his beast right and left he dashed in among them completely <unk> one of the party leaving her on the field and <unk> everybody else except <unk> backing her horse <unk> the incensed queen heaped upon him every <unk> <unk> she could think of until at last the enraged <unk> leaped out of his saddle caught <unk> by her dress and dragging her to the earth struck her repeatedly in the face holding on meanwhile by the hair of her head he was proceeding to <unk> her on the spot when the cries of the frightened attendants brought a crowd of natives to the rescue who bore the nearly insensible queen away but his frantic rage was not yet <unk> he ran to the palace and before it could be prevented <unk> a valuable supply of <unk> a recent present from abroad in the act of <unk> some other <unk> he was seized from behind and carried off with rolling eyes and foaming at the mouth this is a fair example of a <unk> in a passion though the <unk> of mortals in general and hard to be roused when once fairly up he is possessed with a thousand devils the day following <unk> was privately paddled over to <unk> in a canoe where after remaining in <unk> for a couple of weeks he was allowed to return and once more give in his domestic <unk> though <unk> <unk> i be something of a <unk> in private life in her public rule she is said to have been quite <unk> and <unk> this was her true policy for an hereditary hostility to her family had always lurked in the hearts of many powerful chiefs the <unk> of

which they <unk> but while events were <unk> calculated to favour the hopes of the <unk> and <unk> the arrival of the french gave a most unexpected turn to affairs during my sojourn in tahiti a report was <unk> i knew to <unk> with what is generally called the missionary <unk> <unk> and some other chiefs of note had actually agreed for a <unk> <unk> to acquiesce in the <unk> of their country but subsequent events have <unk> the <unk> several of these very men have recently died in battle against the french under the <unk> of the <unk> the great chiefs of tahiti were something like the barons of king john holding <unk> sway over their <unk> valleys and on account of their descent warmly beloved by the people they frequently cut off the royal <unk> by <unk> to pay the customary tribute due from them as <unk> the truth is that with the <unk> of the missionaries the regal office in tahiti lost much of its dignity and influence in the days of <unk> it was supported by all the power of a numerous priesthood and was solemnly connected with the entire superstitious <unk> of the land the monarch claimed to be a sort of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the polynesian <unk> and <unk> to inferior deities his person was thrice holy if he entered an ordinary dwelling never mind for how short a time it was <unk> when he left no common mortal being thought worthy to <unk> it afterward im a greater man than king george said the <unk> young <unk> to the first missionaries he rides on a horse and i on a man such was the case he <unk> post through his dominions on the shoulders of his subjects and <unk> of mortal beings were provided in all the valleys but alas how times have changed how transient human <unk> some years since <unk> <unk> i the <unk> of the proud <unk> went into the <unk> business publicly <unk> by her agents the washing of the linen belonging to the officers of ships touching in her <unk> it is a significant fact and one worthy of record that while the influence of the english missionaries at tahiti has tended to so great a <unk> of the regal dignity there that of the american missionaries at the sandwich islands has been purposely <unk> to bring about a contrary result chapter <unk> we visit the court it was about the middle of the second month of the <unk> and therefore some five weeks after our arrival in <unk> that we at last obtained <unk> to the residence of the queen it happened thus there was a marquesan in the train of <unk> who <unk> as nurse to her children according to the <unk> custom the royal <unk> are carried about until it requires no small degree of strength to stand up under them but <unk> was just the man for <unk> and <unk> well made as a statue and with an arm like a <unk> <unk> thigh embarking at his native island as a sailor on board of a french whaler he afterward ran away from the ship at tahiti where being seen and admired by <unk> he had been prevailed upon to enlist in her service often when visiting the grounds we saw him walking about in the shade carrying two handsome boys who <unk> his neck with their arms <unk> face tattooed as it was in the <unk> style of his tribe was as good as a <unk> to these young <unk> they delighted to trace with their fingers the <unk> of the strange shapes there <unk> the first time my eyes lighted upon the marquesan i knew his country in a moment and hailing him in his own language he turned round surprised that a person so speaking should be a stranger he proved to be a native of tior a glen of nukuheva i had visited the place more than once and so on the island of <unk> we met like old friends in my frequent <unk> with him over the bamboo picket i found this islander a philosopher of <unk> wild heathen <unk> upon the vices and <unk> of the christian court of <unk> savage <unk> the <unk> of the people among whom fortune had thrown him i was amazed at the national feelings of the man no european when abroad could speak of his country with more pride than <unk> he assured me again and again that so soon as he had obtained sufficient money to purchase twenty muskets and as many bags of powder he was going to return to a place with which <unk> was not worthy to be compared it was <unk> who after one or two <unk> attempts at last brought about our admission into the queens grounds through a considerable crowd he conducted us along the <unk> to where an old man was sitting to whom he introduced us as a couple of <unk> of his acquaintance anxious to see the sights of the palace the venerable <unk> stared at us and shook his head the doctor thinking he wanted a <unk> placed a plug of tobacco in his hand this was <unk> and we were permitted to pass on upon the point of entering one of the houses <unk> name was shouted in <unk> different directions and he was obliged to withdraw thus left at the very threshold to shift for ourselves my companions assurance stood us in good <unk> he stalked right in and i followed the place was full of women who instead of exhibiting the surprise we expected accosted us as cordially as if we had called to take our <unk> with them by express invitation in the first place nothing would do but we must each <unk> a calabash of <unk> and several roasted bananas pipes were then lighted and a brisk conversation ensued these ladies of the court if not very polished were <unk> free and easy in their manners quite as much so as king charless beauties there was one of <unk> arch little miss who could converse with us pretty <unk> whom we strove to make ourselves particularly agreeable with the view of engaging her services as <unk> as such she turned out to be everything we could desire no one <unk> her will every place was entered without ceremony <unk> brushed aside mats lifted and each nook and corner <unk> whether the little damsel carried her <unk> <unk> that everything opened to her thus i know not but <unk> himself the <unk> of infants could not have been half so serviceable among other houses which we visited was one of large size and fine exterior the special residence of a <unk> the mate of a merchant <unk> had done himself the honour of <unk> into the <unk> family the lady he wedded being a near <unk> of the queen he became a permanent member of her majestys household this adventurer rose late dressed <unk> in calico and trinkets assumed a <unk> tone in conversation and was evidently upon excellent terms with himself we found him reclining on a mat smoking a <unk> of tobacco in the midst of an admiring circle of chiefs and ladies he must have noticed our approach but instead of rising and offering <unk> he went on talking and smoking without even <unk> to look at us his highness feels his <unk> carelessly observed the doctor the rest of the company gave us the ordinary salutation our guide announcing us beforehand in answer to our earnest <unk> to see the queen we were now conducted to an edifice by far the most spacious in the inclosure it was at least one hundred and fifty feet in length very wide with low eaves and an exceedingly steep roof of <unk> leaves there were neither doors nor <unk> along the sides but the slight posts supporting the rafters between these posts <unk> of fine <unk> and tappa were rustling all round some of them were <unk> or partly withdrawn so as to admit light and air and afford a glimpse now and then of what was going on within pushing aside one of the <unk> we entered the apartment was one immense hall the long and lofty ridgepole fluttering with <unk> <unk> and tassels full forty feet from the ground <unk> of mats piled one upon another extended on either side while here and there were slight <unk> forming as many recesses where groups of <unk> <unk> reclining at their evening meal as we advanced these various parties ceased their <unk> and in explanation of our appearance among them listened to a few <unk> words from our guide the whole scene was a strange one but what most excited our surprise was the <unk> <unk> of the most costly objects from all quarters of the globe cheek by <unk> they lay beside the <unk> native articles without the slightest attempt at order superb <unk> of <unk> <unk> with silver and <unk> <unk> and goblets of cut glass <unk> volumes of plates gilded <unk> sets of <unk> and mathematical instruments the finest <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> laced hats and <unk> garments of all sorts with numerous other matters of european manufacture were strewn about among <unk> calabashes <unk> with <unk> rolls of old tappa and <unk> paddles and <unk> and the ordinary furniture of a <unk> dwelling all the articles first mentioned were doubtless presents from foreign powers they were more or less injured the <unk> and swords were <unk> the finest woods were <unk> and a folio volume of <unk> lay open with a cocoanut shell of some musty preparation <unk> among the miscellaneous furniture of the <unk> apartment where that <unk> young gentleman is being measured for a coat while we were amusing ourselves in this <unk> of <unk> our <unk> plucked us by the <unk> and whispered <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> she is coming to sup then said the doctor staring in the direction indicated what say you paul suppose we step up just then a curtain near by lifted and from a private building a few yards distant the queen entered <unk> she wore a loose <unk> of blue silk with two rich <unk> one red and the other yellow tied about her neck her royal majesty was <unk> she was about the ordinary size rather <unk> her features not very handsome her mouth <unk> but there was a <unk> expression in her face probably <unk> to her late misfortunes from her appearance one would judge her about forty but she is not so old as the queen approached one of the recesses her attendants hurried up escorted her in and <unk> the mats on which she at last reclined two girls soon appeared carrying their <unk> repast and then surrounded by <unk> and <unk> and jars of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> i the <unk> queen of tahiti ate fish and <unk> out of her native calabashes <unk> either knife or <unk> come on whispered long ghost lets have an audience at once and he was on the point of <unk> himself when our guide quite alarmed held him back and <unk> silence the other natives also <unk> and as he was pressing forward raised such an <unk> that <unk> lifted her eyes and saw us for the first she seemed surprised and offended and issuing an order in a commanding tone to several of her women waved us out of the house summary as the <unk> was court <unk> no doubt required our compliance we withdrew making a profound inclination as we disappeared behind the tappa <unk> we departed the ground without seeing <unk> and previous to <unk> over the picket feed our pretty guide after a fashion of our own looking round a few moments after we saw the damsel escorted back by two men who seemed to have been sent after her i trust she received nothing more than a reprimand the next day <unk> informed us that strict orders had been issued to admit no strangers within the palace precincts chapter <unk> which ends the book disappointed in going to court we determined upon going to sea it would never do longer to <unk> on <unk> hospitality and then weary somewhat of life in <unk> like all sailors ashore i at last <unk> for the billows now if her crew were to be credited the leviathan was not the craft to our mind but i had seen the captain and liked him he was an uncommonly tall robust <unk> man in the prime of life there was a deep crimson spot in the middle of each <unk> cheek doubtless the effect of his <unk> he was a <unk> or native of the island of <unk> vineyard adjoining nantucket <unk> would have sworn <unk> sailor and no tyrant previous to this we had rather avoided the leviathans men when they came ashore but now we purposely threw ourselves in their way in order to learn more of the vessel we became acquainted with the third mate a <unk> and an old <unk> right jolly fellow with a face like a <unk> we took him to <unk> and gave him a dinner of baked pig and breadfruit with pipes and tobacco for <unk> the account he gave us of the ship agreed with my own surmises a <unk> old craft never floated and the captain was the finest man in the world there was plenty to eat too and at sea nothing to do but sit on the windlass and sail the only bad trait about the vessel was this she had been launched under some <unk> star and so was a luckless ship in the fishery she dropped her boats into the brine often enough and they frequently got fast to the whales but lance and harpoon almost invariably drew when darted by the men of the leviathan but what of that we would have all the sport of chasing the monsters with none of the <unk> work which follows their capture so hurrah for the coast of japan thither the ship was bound a word now about the hard stories we heard the first time we visited the ship they were nothing but idle <unk> got up by the sailors for the purpose of <unk> us away so as to <unk> the captain who was in want of more hands to lie the longer in a pleasant harbour the next time the <unk> came ashore we flung ourselves in his path when informed of our desire to sail with him he wanted to know our history and above all what countrymen we were we said that we had left a whaler in tahiti some time previous and since then had <unk> the most <unk> <unk> upon a plantation as for our country sailors belong to no nation in particular we were on this occasion both yankees upon this he looked <unk> <unk> and freely told us that he verily believed we were both from <unk> be it known here that american sea captains in the pacific are mortally afraid of these <unk> <unk> who to tell the truth wherever known are in <unk> bad <unk> is there a mutiny on board a ship in the south seas ten to one a <unk> man is the <unk> ashore these fellows are equally riotous it was on this account that we were anxious to conceal the fact of our having belonged to the <unk> though it annoyed me much thus to deny the dashing little craft for the same reason also the doctor <unk> about his <unk> unfortunately one part of our <unk> blue <unk> deemed a sort of <unk> evidence against us for curiously enough an american sailor is generally distinguished by his red frock and an english tar by his blue one thus <unk> the national colours the circumstance was pointed out by the captain and we quickly explained the <unk> but in vain he seemed <unk> <unk> against us and in particular eyed the doctor most <unk> by way of <unk> the tatters pretensions i was throwing out a hint concerning kentucky as a land of tall men when our <unk> turned away abruptly and desired to hear nothing more it was evident that he took long ghost for an exceedingly <unk> character perceiving this i resolved to see what a private interview would do so one afternoon i found the captain smoking a pipe in the dwelling of a portly old <unk> <unk> for a reasonable <unk> did the honours of <unk> to illustrious strangers his guest had just risen from a <unk> meal of baked pig and <unk> pudding and the <unk> of the repast were still visible two <unk> bottles also with their necks wrenched off lay upon the mat all this was encouraging for after a good dinner one feels <unk> and amiable and peculiarly open to conviction so at all events i found the noble <unk> i began by saying that i called for the purpose of setting him right touching certain opinions of his concerning the place of my <unk> was an <unk> <unk> wanted to convince him of the fact after looking me in the eye for some time and by so doing revealing an obvious <unk> in his own <unk> organs he begged me to reach forth my arm i did so wondering what upon earth that useful member had to do with the matter in hand he placed his fingers upon my wrist and holding them there for a moment sprang to his feet and with much enthusiasm pronounced me a yankee every beat of my pulse here <unk> he cried another bottle and when it came with one stroke of a knife he <unk> beheaded it and commanded me to <unk> it to the bottom he then told me that if i would come on board his vessel the following morning i would find the ships articles on the cabin transom this was getting along <unk> but what was to become of the doctor i forthwith made an <unk> allusion to my long friend but it was worse than useless the <unk> swore he would have nothing to do with <unk> my long friend was a bird from <unk> and nothing would make him the man of little faith believe otherwise i could not help loving the <unk> captain but indignant at this most unaccountable prejudice against my comrade i abruptly took leave upon <unk> the doctor of the result of the interview he was greatly <unk> and <unk> declared that the <unk> must be a penetrating fellow he then insisted upon my going to sea in the ship since he well knew how anxious i was to leave as for himself on second thoughts he was no sailor and although lands men very often <unk> part of a whalers crew he did not quite relish the idea of occupying a position so humble in short he had made up his mind to tarry awhile in <unk> i turned the matter over and at last decided upon quitting the island the impulse urging me to sea once more and the prospect of eventually reaching home were too much to be resisted especially as the leviathan so comfortable a craft was now bound on her last whaling cruise and in little more than a years time would be going round cape horn i did not however <unk> to remain in the vessel for the residue of the voyage which would have been <unk> binding myself i merely <unk> for the coming cruise leaving my subsequent movements <unk> for there was no knowing that i might not change my mind and prefer journeying home by short and easy stages the next day i paddled off to the ship signed and sealed and stepped ashore with my <unk> spanish <unk> the ends of my <unk> i forced half of the silver on long ghost and having little use for the remainder would have given it to <unk> as some small return for his kindness but although he well knew the value of the coin not a dollar would he accept in three days time the <unk> came to <unk> and told us that the captain having made good the number of his crew by shipping several islanders had determined upon sailing with the land breeze at dawn the following morning these tidings were received in the afternoon the doctor immediately disappeared returning soon after with a couple of flasks of wine concealed in the folds of his frock through the agency of the marquesan he had purchased them from an <unk> of the court i prevailed upon <unk> to drink a parting shell and even little <unk> actually looking conscious that one of her hopeless <unk> was about leaving <unk> for ever <unk> a few drops from a folded leaf as for the <unk> <unk> her grief was unbounded she even besought me to spend my last night under her own <unk> and then in the morning she would herself paddle me off to the ship but this i would not consent to and so as something to remember her by she presented me with a roll of fine <unk> and another of tappa these gifts placed in my hammock i afterward found very agreeable in the warm latitudes to which we were bound nor did they fail to awaken most grateful <unk> about nightfall we broke away from this <unk> household and hurried down to the water it was a mad merry night among the sailors they had on tap a small cask of wine procured in the same way as the doctors flasks an hour or two after midnight everything was noiseless but when the first <unk> of the dawn showed itself over the mountains a sharp voice hailed the forecastle and ordered the ship <unk> the anchors came up <unk> the sails were soon set and with the early breath of the tropical morning fresh and fragrant from the hillsides we slowly glided down the bay and were swept through the opening in the reef presently we <unk> to and the canoes came alongside to take off the islanders who had accompanied us thus far as he stepped over the side i shook the doctor long and heartily by the hand i have never seen or heard of him since crowding all sail we braced the yards square and the breeze <unk> <unk> straight away from the land once more the sailors <unk> rocked under me and i found myself rolling in my gait by noon the island had gone down in the horizon and all before us was the wide pacific end of the project gutenberg ebook of omoo adventures in the south
